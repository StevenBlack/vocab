of the word is to describe the Mona Lisa's smile. A nice way to say that you

epicenter. Epicene means reflecting both male and female characteristics;
androgynous. The word has also acquired a secondary meaning as effeminate or

A disciple, not famous in his own right, of a famous writer. If there were a
good example, he wouldn't be a proper epigone because he'd be famous.


### epigram
A witty little remark such as: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." Oscar
Wilde was famous for his epigrams. The quotation at the beginning of a book,

### epiphany
The religious meaning is a Christian feast celebrated on January 6 to
commemorate the appearance of Christ, but the word is also used to mean a sudden

meaning "leaving no doubt."

### esprit d'escalier
You probably never knew that there was a word for this—a clever remark or reply
that you didn't think of at the appropriate moment but thought of too late, as
in "I should have said..." It comes from the French phrase, "up the stairs":
"I didn't think of a snappy retort to D'Artagnan until I was already up the
stairs." The next time you find yourself speechless, just say, "When I come up
with the esprit d'escalier, I'll give you a call."


### esprit de corps

### frisson
A shiver, as from a thrill or a fright. A frisson passes through an audience
watching the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The word is best used as
a reaction to situations that intend to scare, such as roller coaster rides or

Very bright; shining or radiant. A good word for describing things like the
spaceship in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or the full moon.

### fulsome
The word originally meant "disgustingly excessive" or "copious." It has evolved
to connote disgusting, tasteless and generally repellent. It's often confused

is probably not pretty at all. It's a good word to use when you want to insult
someone covertly.

of bread is fungible with another. In a recession, some employers find certain
employees fungible.

she is brilliant; in fact, I don't find her smart at all."


### galactoid

"milk-like." The only overlap in the intended and misused meanings then would be
the Milky Way. Coffee creamers are galactoid. So is the blood of many insects.


### Gambler's Fallacy
We often feel we're owed luck for being unlucky. "The coin was heads 10 flips
in a row, the next flip has gotta be tails!" But probability has no memory;
it won't make amends for its past behavior. Therefore, treat every possibility
independent of the past.


### garrulous
Excessively talkative in a silly, chattering way. Often misused to mean just
plain friendly and willing to talk, which is loquacious. Save garrulous to
describe relatives who call frequently and make it impossible to get off the

### gatefold
This is a large page, folded and bound into a book or magazine. Examples are
those expensive car or perfume advertisements in magazines or, most frequently,

of literature.

Another way of saying relevant, pertinent or appropriate, but strictly reserved
for referring to ideas. You couldn't say that wearing a certain pair of shoes

conversation about classical music, James Brown is probably not germane.


### gerrymander

party an advantage.


### gestalt

tiny meme-pool.


### googol

is commonly used to describe any complex problem begging for a drastic solution.

comes across with the pronunciation. If your car breaks down on the third lap of

### gudgeon
An easy mark, someone who is duped without effort. The guys who play three-card
monte on the street are just waiting for a gudgeon to come along so they can
beat him and make a quick twenty bucks. Though the word sounds a bit archaic, it
has a nice lumbering sound. Also a metal pivot—see pintle.


### gullible
Often misused, this isn't really a word. It's not in the dictionary. (Got ya'!
Sorry, but we couldn't resist!)


### gunkhole
Though it sounds like a noun, this word is really a verb which means to sail

who's more than 20 years old and less than five feet tall, but the word is
more commonly used figuratively to mean "the little man inside the box making

or computers. Your mind is nothing more than a skull with a homunculus inside,
making the decisions (who's inside the homunculus? another homunculus!).

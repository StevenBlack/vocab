a contrario
Latin: from the opposite.


a falsis principiis proficisci
Latin: to set forth from false principles.


a priori
Proceeding from cause to effect; reasoning from a general law to a particular
instance. This describes a deductive approach to a chain of reasoning. If the
polar ice caps melted, your a priori conclusion would be the eventual flooding
of coastal areas. A second meaning is "presumptive" or "conjectural"—based
on theory or preconception rather than fact, as in an a priori conclusion.


abdabs
So nervous, you jitter and quake. One hopes that diamond cutters, professional
golfers and brain surgeons don't suffer from the abdabs.


abide
(used without object): To remain; continue; stay: Abide with me. To have
one's abode; dwell; reside: To continue in a particular condition, attitude,
relationship, etc.; last. (used with object): to put up with; tolerate; stand:
I can't abide dishonesty! To endure, sustain, or withstand without yielding
or submitting: To abide a vigorous onslaught. To wait for; await: To abide
the coming of the Lord. To accept without opposition or question: To abide the
verdict of the judges. To pay the price or penalty of; suffer for.


abject
Extremely humiliated or debased; the bottom of the barrel. The word is most
often used in conjunction with either "failure" or "poverty." The migrant
farmers in Woody Guthrie songs lived in abject poverty.


ablution
A ritual cleansing. This can literally be a bath, or, more commonly, a spiritual
purification. Vestal virgins probably engage in this kind of activity since they
have a lot of time on their hands.


abnegate
To deny oneself something (usually something a little more serious than giving
up chocolate cake). You can abnegate the religion you were born into, for
example.


abrogate
To formally annul or cancel, as in a contract or a treaty, rather than a
promise. Often misused to mean "breach" or "violate"—when you hear the word
used that way, jump in and explain the subtle yet important distinction. "He
abrogated the agreement by ripping up the contract and refusing to accept any
more shipments of pineapples." Distinguish this from breaching the agreement by
accepting the shipments, but refusing to pay for them.


absolution
A release from guilt, sin or sentence. More than just forgiveness, absolution
implies a kind of freedom from moral responsibility. To be on the safe side,
it's best to avoid acts that require absolution, since it might not be offered.
Say AB-SO-LOO-SHUN.


abstemious
Originally defined as taking food and drink in moderation, now expanded to mean
temperance in all things. Those who drink deeply from the cup of life are hardly
abstemious.


abstruse
Complicated; difficult to comprehend. Like the theory of relativity, atonal
music or the philosophers you pretended to understand in college. The next best
thing to understanding Hegel would be to describe him as abstruse and move on.


acerbic
Harsh; severe; biting. Commonly used to mean sarcastic, the actual meaning is
stronger. A truly acerbic wit can draw blood. Don Rickles isn't acerbic. He's
too nice.


acolyte
An attendant, assistant or novice. Not a slave, but a follower. Disciples follow
a leader—acolytes empty her ashtray. A brilliant professor or an innovative
employer will often attract acolytes.


acrimony
Biting sharpness or bitterness. It's used to describe words, attitude or
disposition, not food. Old coffee is bitter; hostile divorces lead to acrimony
between partners, and vice versa.


acuminate
Sharpened or tapered to a point—can be used as an adjective or verb. A candle
or a sword is acuminate. The next time you need to sharpen your pencil during
the SATs, raise your hand and explain that your #2 needs to be acuminated.


adduce
To offer a series of facts that will help the recipient prove something.
Therefore, you can adduce someone to deduce a conclusion. "Talented salesman
that I am, I adduced the customer to my way of thinking by demonstrating how
effective the Elektra was at picking up dust."


adulatory
Excessive devotion to someone; servile flattery.


adventitious
Added accidentally, casually or from an outside source. Buying a house in
winter and discovering that in spring, the property is filled with tulips and
lilies is adventitious. On the other hand, being the one millionth customer
at a dealership and winning a brand new Corvette is serendipitous. (See
serendipitous.)


aesthete
A lover of beauty. Sort of an athlete of the arts. If you belong to PBS, have a
membership at the local art museum and drive a 1964 Lotus, you are both wealthy
and an aesthete. Though it can be spelled esthete, the snootier spelling is
aesthete.


affectation
An effort to appear to have a quality not really or fully possessed; the
pretense of actual possession: An affectation of interest in art; affectation
of great wealth. Conspicuous artificiality of manner or appearance; effort to
attract notice by pretense, assumption, or any assumed peculiarity. A trait,
action, or expression characterized by such artificiality: a man of a thousand
affectations. Strenuous pursuit, desire, or aspiration. Affection; fondness: his
affectation of literature.


afflated
Having inspiration, inspired.


agelast
A person who never laughs. Words like "dour" or "stern" are more temporary—
reserve agelast for longterm sourpusses.


agent provocateur
A French expression describing a political spy who provokes people to perform an
illegal action that will lead to their arrest. These characters are frequently
seen in 1940s spy films. Third-world governments often use them to promote
riots, thus giving an excuse for martial law.


agio
The fee charged by money brokers for exchanging one foreign currency for another.
Not to be confused with the Spanish word for garlic, which is ajo.


aglet
The covering at the end of a shoelace. Of all the words for a-thing-that-should-
have-a-name-but-youcan-never-remember-what-it-is, this is the easiest to use
in conversation.


agnotological statement
A statement designed to propagate ignorance, or cast doubt on scientific fact.


agnotology
The study of deliberate, culturally-spread ignorance, typically to sell a
product or win favour, particularly through the publication of inaccurate or
misleading scientific data.


agrypnia
Insomnia. The kind of word you stay awake trying to remember.


ailurophilic
Lover of cats; the opposite of ailurophobia. Admittedly, "cat lover" is a lot
easier to say, but you can use ailurophilic when you don't want your dog to know
how you feel.


ailuropholic
An abnormal fear of cats.


ait
A favorite crossword-puzzle word. A small island in a river or lake, such as lie
de la Cité in the Seine.


alacrity
Cheerfulness; liveliness. Good news is usually delivered with great alacrity.


aleatory
Uncertain; dependent on chance. Random, such as the throw of dice. Playing the
lottery is an aleatory undertaking; playing blackjack is part aleatory, part
skill.


algorithm
A method for solving a mathematical problem. You can win or tie every game of
tic tac toe by following a simple algorithm—start in the middle, then block any
move made by your opponent.


alliaceous
Smelling or tasting of garlic or onions, such as one's breath after a great
Italian meal. The alliaceous meal was delicious; her breath was not. It's
pronounced AL- EE-AY-SHUSS.


alliteration
A poetic device in which words that begin with the same sound are strung
together. "Helplessly hoping her harlequin hovers nearby ---------- " Score big
points by identifying alliteration wherever you find it.


amanuensis
A scribe; someone employed to take dictation or copy what another has written.
John Milton's wife was his amanuensis; Milton dictated Paradise Lost to her.
Many secretaries are amanuenses, but they prefer to be called administrative
assistants.


ameliorate
To make a bad situation better. When something is ameliorated, it's improved.
Not usually used in a medical environment; better to refer to a political or
social situation. Some say that World War II helped ameliorate the effects of
the Depression.


amphigory
A nonsensical composition or parody, often made of sounds that imitate words
and rhyme, or words that rhyme but have no logical meaning. An example is the
writing of Dr. Seuss when he says about eating green eggs and ham: "Would you
like them in a house? Would you like them with a mouse?"


anachronism
A person or event erroneously placed in time. Although it can be used either
way, the word usually describes something from the past intruding upon the
present in a contradictory or paradoxical way. Space people from the future
would not usually be called an anachronism, but a person with a black-and-white
TV and a gramophone would.


analects
Selected extracts from the writings of one or more authors. Usually associated
with Confucius, as in The Analects of Confucius, or with Mao—although the word
is by no means limited to Asian writing.


ancillary
This word is often used to mean secondary, but it actually means supplementary,
as in "the ancillary benefits to this job are its good location and the friendly
staff." The word is


anomaly
An unexpected result that deviates from the standard. A anomaly, as is a book on
underwater gardening that makes it to the best-seller lists.


anomie
The breakdown of norms, ethics and values in a person or in society. Graft,
corruption and rioting are all signs of anomie.


antediluvian
This word literally means "before the Biblical flood," but it's come to connote
generally ancient or antiquated. Someone with very old-fashioned ideas might
jestingly be described as antediluvian.


antepenultimate
The third from the last in a series; the word or thing that precedes the second
to last (or penultimate) and the last. A useful word when discussing a piece of
writing, as in: "It says here in the antepenultimate paragraph . . ."


anthropomorphism
Assignment of human-like attributes to inanimate objects or animals. People tend
to anthropomorphise computers: "The computer gets upset when I type this." The
word can be used to refer to fairy tales about singing trees and talking frogs.


antithetical
Something that is in direct opposition to something else is antithetical to it.
The word has a larger meaning than just plain "opposite." Rich is the opposite
of poor; booking a rap music group at a staid, elegant French restaurant would
be antithetical to the restaurant's atmosphere.


aphasia
Loss or impairment of speech, or of the power to understand written or spoken
language. It's rare to find a permanent case in real life, but temporary aphasia
is all around us. A great excuse when your boss catches you snoozing at a
meeting; she'll be too stunned to look up the word.


aphorism
A terse saying embodying a general truth, or astute observation, as “Power tends
to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely”.


aplomb
Self-assurance, especially under duress.


apocrine
Of or relating to certain glands whose secretions are acted upon by bacteria to
produce the characteristic odor of perspiration (distinguished from eccrine).


apocryphal
Of doubtful authenticity; practically a fable. Not like Paul Bunyan; more like
Babe Ruth calling his home run. As we have lost our ability to believe real
fables, many apocryphal stories have been created about heroes such as Kennedy
and Hemingway.


apogee
Refers to the point in the orbit of the moon when the moon is furthest from the
earth, but has come to refer to any figurative high point or climax, as in a
career. Being elected President would be the apogee of a politician's career;
failing to be re-elected would be the nadir. (See nadir.)


apophasis
Rhetoric: denial of one's intention to speak of a subject that is at the same
time named or insinuated, as “I shall not mention Caesar's avarice, nor his
cunning, nor his morality.” Theology: knowledge, understanding, or description
of God through negative statements about qualities and characteristics that God
does not possess, as "God is not confined by space or time."


aposiopesis
Breaking off in the middle of a statement upon suddenly realizing that someone's
feelings are hurt or about to be hurt. "The reason I didn't invite your wife to
the party is that everybody thinks she's...well, never mind." You may never find
occasion to actually use the word, but it's nice to know there's a word for that
particular gaffe or faux pas. (See gaffe and faux pas.)


apostasy
Abandonment of one's religion, politics or principles. Not to be confused with
apostle. St. Matthew was an apostle; Judas was an apostate.


apothegm
A pithy saying. Mark Twain specialized in them. So did Yogi Berra.


apotheosis
The elevation or exaltation of a person to the rank of a god. Also, an
ideal example; epitome; quintessence: "This poem is the apotheosis of lyric
expression."


argot
Slang belonging to a specific group or class. When you know the argot of
computers, you can talk with the hackers in the MIS department.


arrant
Downright; thorough; unmitigated; notorious: "an arrant fool." Also wandering;
errant.


arriviste
Someone who has acquired success by dubious means and who insists on flaunting
it. A contemporary example would be Ivan Boesky, John Gotti or even Jessica
Hahn. Unless they go to jail, one generation's arrivistes are another's old
money.


arrogate
To claim for oneself without justification, such as Germany arrogating the
Sudetenland prior to World War II. Can you arrogate the plum assignments from
your rival coworker?


artifice
A clever trick or stratagem; a cunning, crafty device or expedient; wile.
Trickery; guile; craftiness. Cunning; ingenuity; inventiveness. A skillful or
artful contrivance or expedient.


ascetic
Self-denying; austere. A hedonist loves pleasure; an ascetic shuns it. In
Eastern culture, ascetics eschew (see eschew) anything not necessary to maintain
life, thus taking them one step closer to nirvana. (See nirvana.)


assiduous
Persevering and careful. A good quality for scientific researchers or
investigative reporters. The implication is that assiduous behavior brings with
it thoroughness and even temper. Not necessarily true.


assonance
Describes two words in which the vowels rhyme but the consonants don't—such as
mama and dada. Without assonance, you've got no other way to describe it!


assuage
To relieve or ease. Through good works, charity and good behavior, you can
assuage your guilt about fudging your income tax report. But that probably won't
save you from an audit. (See also absolution.)


astir
Moving or stirring, especially with much activity or excitement: "The field was
astir with small animals, birds, and insects." Up and about; out of bed.


atavistic
Exhibiting traits of an ancestor or an earlier evolutionary form. Members of
a mob can become atavistic and commit violent acts which, as individuals, they
might shun. A smart way to say "barbaric."


augment
To add on, in the sense of increasing in size or amount. A person augments his
salary with a moonlighting job, or augments a collection of stamps by buying the
valuable one with the upside-down airplane on it. You can also augment parts of
your body, hence the term "breast augmentation surgery."


augur
To prophesy the future. When Boris Yeltsin took over the USSR, it did not
augur well for the KGB. (Is this word ever used without "well" attached to it?)


autodidact
A person who teaches himself a subject, such as a foreign language or solid
geometry. The word can also refer to a person who enjoys hearing himself talk
even though few others do. Maybe it's because he's so smug for having taught
himself something without the help of experts.


autolatry
Worship of the self. The next time you want to insult that narcissistic, self-
involved egomaniac you know, tell him he engages in autolatry.


avatar
The incarnation or manifestation of a deity or an idea. An example is the
burning bush or the Greek gods appearing in human form. Today, you could use the
word to describe a project that embodied your ideas. The space program was JFK's
avatar. No doubt avatar will end up being a make of car before long.


avocado
Of course you know what an avocado is. But did you know that it is one of the
few words derived from the Aztec? The original meaning is "testicle," so now
you have something interesting to say when you're offered guacamole. (The Aztecs
thought the avocado was an aphrodisiac.) Also worth noting: You can keep your
guacamole from turning brown by placing an avocado pit in it.


avuncular
Like an uncle; kind. Here's the hard part—what do you call someone who's like
an aunt? Avauntular? Regardless, try to be avuncular to all of the children
you meet.


babbitt
A reference to the eponymous (see eponymous) title of Sinclair Lewis's best-
known novel, the word has come to mean a person who blindly conforms to middle-
class standards. Until recently, a male babbitt always drove a four-door
American car, belonged to the Lions club, wore a dark suit and went to church
every Sunday.


babelism
A chaotic situation where people cannot communicate because of different
languages.


babelize
To make something confused or incomprehensible— derived from the biblical Tower
of Babel. If you earn an advanced degree in your ability to babelize, you can be
certain of a job at the IRS.


bacchanal
A drunken, riotous orgy, or anyone who parties in the style of the Roman god
Bacchus. You can refer to party revelers as bacchanals or to the party itself as
a bacchanal. No place for abstemious (see abstemious) people.


bacchanalian
Characterized by or given to drunken revelry; riotously drunken.


badinage
Playful, teasing banter, the kind of conversation that makes English drawing-
room comedy so much fun to watch, even though there's no action. Best done by
Tracy and Hepburn. Pronounced BAH-DEH-NAHJ .


Baedeker
A publisher of very good travel books. The word has come to describe any
complete travel guide. Pronounced BAY-DIK-ER.


bagatelle
An unimportant trifle. (Not a loaf of French bread.) It's best used to describe
a knickknack or a small good deed.


bailiwick
In one's area of interest or authority; the word derives from the area in
which a bailiff, a minor court officer, presides. When the V.P. of Sales starts
walking around the factory, complain that she's stepping into your bailiwick.
Say it BALE-EE-WIK.


baleful
Extremely harmful; pernicious. Often confused with doleful, which means sad. The
children in Keane paintings have doleful expressions; Roy Cohn's approach to his
fellow human beings was baleful.


balletomane
A ballet-lover, who for some reason is not called a balletophile. While we're
on the topic, if a female ballet star is called a ballerina, why don't they call
Barishnykov a ballerino? (Just wondering.) Pronounced BAH-LET-EH-MANE.


baluster
One of the series of pillars that supports a banister along a staircase. (Now
you don't have to call it a thingee any longer!)


balustrade
A banister plus all the balusters (see above) that hold up the banister.
Pronounced BAL-UH-STRAYDE.


barm
Another word for the froth or head on a glass of beer. As in: "On a hot day,
there's nothing like an ice cold beer with a good barm."


bas-relief
A sculpture or carved work in which projecting parts stand out slightly from
their surrounding surface. When touring European cities for the first time,
you may use this word about 400 times a day to describe carved doors, walls,
pedestals, graves and a host of other ruins.


base rate fallacy
Cognitive bias — the tendency to ignore base rate information (generic, general
information) and focus on specific information (information only pertaining to a
certain case).


bathos
A fall from the sublime to the commonplace; often used to describe the plot of
a play, a movie or a piece of fiction which tells how the mighty have fallen.
The word should be distinguished from pathos (see pathos), which means evoking
genuine pity or compassion.


battologize
To write or repeat words or phrases over and over and over and over, again and
again and again and again.


bauhaus
Not a place to put Fido at night. A school of architecture and design developed
in Germany in 1918, which emphasized the functional aspect of objects over their
form. The style is typified by the box-like buildings of Mies Van der Rohe, who
was famous for his aesthetic theory that "less is more."


bavardage
Foolish or nonsensical talk with a touch of light banter. Friends might engage
in bavardage by hurling meaningless insults at one another—without hurting
anyone's feelings. It's similar to badinage (see badinage) but has a more
playful tone. In modernparlance, "dissing," but without malice.


beau geste
Literally a "pretty gesture," an act that is meaningless, but looks good or has
the effect of generosity or conciliation. An example is sending flowers to the
host after a dinner party.


beaver
Besides the busy little animal that builds dams, this word also describes the
piece of a suit of armor that is jointed below the ears and protects the mouth
and chin.


bedizen
To vulgarly dress or gaudily accessorize; too many bangles and beads. An ugly, old
woman. Not to be confused with beldam bedlam, which means "confusion."


beguile
To deceive or delude (using guile); to charm, delight or captivate; to cause
(time) to seem to pass quickly, by way of pleasant diversion.


bel-esprit
A verbal, witty, intellectually lively person; the person at the party who's
telling an amusing little story to a circle of delighted hangers-on. The
personality shy people covet. Pronounce the word BELL-ESS-PREE.


bellwether
The leader of the pack; the one everyone else follows. Contrary to popular
belief, the word has nothing to do with the weather—which is why it is so
frequently misspelled. It does, however, have something to do with bells, since
the word comes from the male sheep which leads the flock and usually wears a
bell around his neck.


benighted
Ignorant; not so much stupid, but backward. People who are benighted are also a
bit pathetic, such as the street urchins in Dickens's novels who, neglected by
society, can neither read nor write.


benthos
The animals and plants, snails, anemones and such that live at the bottom of the
sea. Not much of a stretch to use the term to vilify the telephone operator who
just cut you off.


beset
to set or stud with or as if with ornaments; example: a crown beset with rubies.
Trouble, harass, assail.


besetting
Constantly present or attacking; obsessive.


betime
Early, soon; often misused to mean "sometimes." "I will be there betimes" means
"I'll see you soon." A small decorative object that is prized for its beauty or
s rarity; the kind of porcelain figurine or little brass


bias blind spot
Cognitive bias: the bias blind spot is the cognitive bias of recognizing the
impact of biases on the judgment of others, while failing to see the impact of
biases on one's own judgment.


bibelot
pot that decorates a coffeetable or bookcase. Better than a knickknack.
Pronounced BIB-LO.


biblioclast
A person who destroys books; the word can also be used to describe people
who break the bindings of paperbacks and keep their place by folding down the
corners of pages. Biblioclasts are despised by bibliophages, people with a
passion for reading.


bibulous
Given to drinking alcohol, but not necessarily an alcoholic; for example, the
person at the table who orders wine or beer when everyone else has ordered a
soda.


bifurcate
To split into two parts or branches; to fork. Though you can say that a road is
bifurcated, and you can certainly bifurcate a crab before you eat it, the word
is most often used to describe ideas or concepts. Pronounced BYE-FUR-KATE.


biggin
The perforated basket that contains the grounds in a coffeepot. The word can
probably be stretched to mean the plastic holder where you put the paper filter
in a Mr. Coffee.


bilbulous
Fond of or addicted to drink. Absorbent. Spongy.


bildungsroman
Literally, a novel of education—a coming-of-age story. J.D. Salinger's novel
Catcher in the Rye is a classic example.


billet-doux
A love letter. Take a minute to send one today— you'll be amazed at the
difference it makes in your relationship.


biotic
Having to do with life, in a scientific sense. You can be worried about the
ecology, the rainforests, the ozone layer or the biotic activity in the Pacific
Northwest. People on macrobiotic diets apparently believe that they are getting
enormous amounts of life, which is odd, given that they eat almost nothing and
weigh even less.


birl
A nifty way to say "logrolling." Standing on a log while it revolves under you.
Or, stretching a little, what a gerbil does in one of those exercise wheels:
"Henry! Come watch the little gerbil birl!"


bisextile
A good deal more mundane than bisexual, this word refers to events that fall
on February 29, the extra day of a leap year. If you have a bisextile birthday,
you'll age only 25 years each century. You may not use this word often, but when
you do, you'll feel great.


bivouac
An encampment, used either as a noun or a verb. Soldiers bivouac a lot, as do
characters in Hemingway novels.


blandish
To try to convince with flattering words; to cajole. One may blandish a child to
get out of a swimming pool on a hot day. The word has nothing to do with being
bland or boring.


blithe
Casually careless or indifferent; showing a lack of concern. "She had a blithe
disregard of cultures outside the United States."


bloviate
To speak or write verbosely and windily.


blowzy
Unkempt; messy. Hair out of place or an untucked shirt hanging out of a business
suit qualify as blowzy. Can also mean "ruddy-faced and flushed." Rhymes with
lousy.


bluestocking
A woman who devotes herself to scholarly or literary pursuits but who is not
necessarily formally educated. Think of the schoolteacher in all of those Clint
Eastwood westerns. The expression comes from a group of 18thcentury women who
gathered in each other's houses to talk about books. Some of these women wore
informal blue or gray wool stockings instead of black silk ones.


boondoggle
Though the word is now used to describe the kind of conventions that are held in
tropical places to give employees a chance for some paid vacation time, the word
literally means "busy work," meaningless tasks carried out laboriously to create
the appearance of being busy.


bootless
Useless; fruitless; to no avail. Thus the line from Shakespeare's sonnet "...
and trouble deaf Heaven with my bootless cries" does not refer to someone
praying with his shoes off.


boulevardier
A man-about-town; the kind of guy who makes sure he's seen at the trendiest
restaurants and the hippest clubs. The model/artist/fashion set.


bovine
Scientists use this phrase to classify the family that includes buffalo, kudus,
oxen and cows. Often used derogatorily to describe fat, lazy dullards who move
slowly and always seem to be chewing their cuds.


bowdlerize
To edit a piece of writing by cutting out all the obscene parts. In certain
Middle Eastern countries, some Western magazines are bowdlerized from cover
to cover. The word derives from the name of Thomas Bowdler, who had the gall
to issue an expurgated edition of the works of that well-known pornographer,
William Shakespeare.


brachiation
To progress by swinging from hold to hold by the arms.


brachycerous
Having short antennae.


brocade
As a verb: to decorate fabric with raised woven patterns. As a noun: a thick
heavy fabric into which raised patterns have been woven, originally in gold
and silver; more recently any cloth incorporating raised, woven patterns.
Metaphorically: a decorative pattern.


bromide
A trite or hackneyed remark or a boring person who speaks in meaningless
platitudes. Political candidates, bad teachers and dull members of the clergy
are famous for uttering (or being) bromides. Also used to describe a drink taken
to relieve indigestion. Thus, depending on the intended meaning, a bromide can
either soothe or turn one's stomach.


bruin
A bear. People who call their office "work-o-rama" and their friend Bill "the
Billster!" probably refer to Yogi Bear as a "bruin." You can tell them that the
term comes from the Dutch word for "brown," and that Bern, Switzerland, is named
after the Swiss word for bear.


brussels sprout
Some people like this tiny cabbage-like vegetable. Note that it is not brussel
sprout, which is what less careful people might call it. A huge bowl of the
stuff would thus be called brussels sprouts. Difficult to say quickly, but
correct nonetheless.


bumptious
Overbearing or self-assertive to the point of being obnoxious; conceited
bordering on arrogant. Salespeople in trendy, expensive shops can be bumptious.
Pronounced BUMP-SHUSS.


cabal
A group engaged in secret plotting against authority. A cabal might be a
political faction that scorns the government, or a splinter group of employees
dissatisfied with the head of their department. Often associated with witches.
Pronounced KUH-BAHL.


cache
A hidden treasure. Not the kind found in chests under the sea but of more
personal value, such as a cache of chocolates in a night-table drawer or a cache
of sharpened pencils hidden from coworkers. For some reason, police always seem
to find guns hidden in caches.


cachet
A mark of distinction, a stamp of approval by a recognized authority. Could
be the Levi's label or Louis Vuitton luggage. The word has come to describe a
certain style which someone always seems to have.


cachinate
To laugh too loud or too hard. Much more than a giggle, and with a bit of
unnatural excess, such as nervous laughter after hearing bad news. Good example
of onomatopoeia (see onomatopoeia).


cacology
Bad diction or pronunciation.


cadence
A balanced, rhythmic flow or movement. You can talk about the cadence of a
marching band, for example, or use the term figuratively, to describe art or a
babbling brook.


cadre
A group of people who train others in an expanding organization. Often used
in a military context: "Cadres of medical personnel were sent to the field
hospitals." During the 1950s, Communists always seemed to be organized in
cadres.


caitiff
A despicable lowlife; a contemptible or cowardly person. Should be pronounced
CAY-TIFF, probably through clenched teeth, with a sneer. Reserve the term for
traitors and people who hurt others to further themselves.


cajole
To coax or encourage, usually to get someone to do something she doesn't want
to do but that's good for her, such as take her medicine or get some rest.


callow
Green; inexperienced; lacking maturity. You almost always hear the word combined
with "youth," as in "Those callow youths don't appreciate the finer things in
life."


calumny
A false statement designed to harm someone's reputation. It's intentional and
malicious but has no particular legal implications like libel or slander. A
jealous person might accuse a rival, or a candidate might accuse an opponent,
of calumny.


camber
To arch upward in the middle. A rainbow cambers; so does a gentle hill. Downhill
skis are cambered— the center is a few inches higher than the tip or heel.


cambist
A classy way to describe someone who is a little too sharp with money. A
currency trader or a particularly zealous auctioneer is a cambist. Every school
has at least one kid who manages to trade each item in his bagged lunch for some
combination of cash and pizza. He's a cambist.


campanile
A bell tower that is usually separate from surrounding buildings. Far more
common in Europe than in the States.


canard
A rumor, sham, false report or playful hoax—though less ominous than the War of
the Worlds radio broadcast. You could accuse someone of perpetrating a canard
about the state of your business.


canonize

canonize the works of minority writers. One can speak of being included among
the canon of great poets, for instance. Also used to describe the process of
transforming ordinary people into saints.


canorous
Pleasant-sounding, melodious and resonant. Could be used to describe organ
music, or the sound of a rainstorm against the windowpanes. It may sound like
cantankerous (cranky), but means something completely different.


caparison
To dress sumptuously; to gussy up. Although the word originally referred to the
ornamental covering for a horse, it has come to be used for people as well, such
as when heads of state get fully caparisoned for a ball at the White House.


capriccio
Not an Italian coffee. A capriccio is a frolic or caper, such as when a bunch of
friends spontaneously decide to jump into a car and drive to the beach for the
day.

were threatened with extinction and the practice was outlawed in most countries.

self-protective people—or the pate of a bald man.

An architectural support column in the form of a draped female figure—the kind
of structure, often seen in museums and Greek ruins, that resembles the Venus de
Milo. (Not a bug; that's a katydid.)


castrophenia
Believing that your thoughts are being stolen by your competitors. Screenwriters
often suffer from castrophenia when they see that the movie they were just about
to write has appeared in neighborhood theaters. Not Castrophilia—that's love of
Fidel Castro, in case you were interested.


casuistry

alliance." In diplomatic terms, it describes a situation in which the terms of
an alliance come into play, such as one nation being attacked by another.


catafalque
The raised platform that holds a coffin containing a corpse during funeral
ceremonies. A funeral is no place to show off your vocabulary, though, so you'll

Pronounced CAT-A-FALK.


catchpenny

catharsis
Originally referred to the emotional release, the necessity of which was created
by Greek tragedy. Catharsis has come to mean any purging or release of emotions.
Crying at the movies is considered cathartic. A debate continues to rage over
whether violent movies offer catharsis—do they decrease violence among viewers
or encourage it? Pronounced CAH- THAR-sis.

you've got what you want.


chaff
Back when we were agrarian, the word referred to the stuff left over after
harvesting wheat.

and says he can cure baldness.

presentation, the word has come to refer to any group of professionals who get

than "wary." One would be chary before investing in a risky stock or walking

chasm
A huge gap or deep hole. "Bored with life, he leaped into the chasm." It can
also be used figuratively to describe a gulf—the chasm between rich and poor,
for example.


chasmophile
A lover of nooks and crannies. Someone who likes sifting through the shelves
of used-book stores, rummaging through flea markets and browsing in antique
stores is probably a chasmophile. So are chipmunks, mice and an assortment of
other field animals who nest in the rafters of old attics.


cheap-jack
A peddler who sells cheap goods, like the people who sell underwear or tin
earrings or inexpensive sunglasses at a flea market.


cheechako
A greenhorn; not an insult, merely a different way of calling someone

will add sparkle and spice to your vocabulary.

bias which causes people to think individuals are more attractive when they are
in a group.

clemency
Mercy or forgiveness, especially in choosing punishment. "The judge displayed
clemency in letting the thief go free because it was his first offense." "The

the final exam." Because clemency conveys mildness, the word is also used to
describe the weather: clement weather is perfect for a bike ride; inclement
weather is generally stormy.

Intelligentsia; the collective group of educated people. In order to be a member
of the clerisy, it helps to know what the word means.

typeface used. In this age of desktop publishing, they're coming back in style.

twice is contumacious.

have the courage to admit the truth about something. Pronounced CRAY-VEN.

A finger or a toe. You have twenty dactyls; most birds have six. Pterodactyls
had three-toed feet (get it?). Rhymes with fractal.


dada
A movement of art that hypothesized, "since art is everything, everything is
art." That's why there are urinals and baseballs on exhibit in art museums. Not
limited to the visual arts; use dada to describe any approach that is silly,
stupid or ridiculous. Assonant with mama (see assonnance).


daymare
Yes, this is a word, and it means an anxiety attack— kind of like a nightmare
during the daytime.

yacht, the vice president becomes the de facto leader of the company. On the
other hand, if the president of the company is on the vice-president's yacht, he
becomes the de facto captain.


de profundis
A Latin phrase for "out of the depths." Someone is pulled de profundis from
sleep, meditation or thought. It has nothing to do with "profound," which makes
the word an excellent excuse for why you weren't paying attention to whomever
was speaking to you. Pronounced DAY PRO-FUND-ISS.


de trop
From the French "too much," the word means overdone or excessive in a figurative
sense. Wearing too much jewelry while working in a homeless shelter would be
de trop. Unfortunately, using the word de trop is probably de trop in most
situations and should be accompanied by an appropriate expression of mock
snobbery.


dearth
A shortage or scarcity. Squirrels might have a dearth of nuts by the end of the
winter. Single women might complain of the dearth of heterosexual single men who
are sensitive and willing to make a commitment.

those sufficiently upper-class to consider calling others low-class. Also used

that reveals regret, outrage or anger. One decries pollution of the environment

children. It seems that such an important-sounding word should mean something
else, which is why people will be stunned when you use it properly.

degage
Not emotionally involved; more of an emotional state than merely being
intellectually objective. A friend listening to an argument between other
friends is degage. An umpire or a referee or a judge is at least meant to be
degage.


delusion
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/delusion

emotions of his constituents; there's an element of charisma and danger in it.

descry
To see or discover something, after careful observation. A flock of birds on the

your eyes or intellectually comprehending something that is difficult. It should
not be confused with decry, which means to put down or disparage.

desultory
Casually arranged, without particular or apparent structure. Clothes strewn
on a bed lie there in a desultory fashion. Couples going nowhere in particular
may stroll desultorily on a warm summer night; conversations about nothing
in particular may go on in a desultory way. The word has nothing to do with
depression, which some think it might. Pronounced DEH-SUHL-TI/H-REE.


detente
A relaxation of tensions between nations. Popularized by Henry Kissinger, this
is a great concept and a great word to use in other situations. Coke and Pepsi
could end a price war by agreeing to a detente; what's the point of mutual
destruction? Pronounced DAY- TAHNT.


detritus
Both a literal and figurative way of saying "debris." Empty soda cans on a beach
are detritus; so are street punks who are looking for trouble.

detumescence
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/detumescence


deus ex machina
Originally in classical Greek drama, the god that came down to earth to solve a
problem that couldn't be solved by any logical turn of events. It now refers to

a noun; it's just a different way of saying bilingual. Polyglot is the next step
up. Pronounced DYE-GLOT.


dilatory

nothing to do with dilating, which is what your eye doctor does to your pupils,
or depilatory, which is a fancy way to say Nair.


dilettante
A person with a superficial interest in art or any branch of knowledge; a
dabbler. A dilettante is a person who doesn't hold a job and spends the days
browsing through museums, taking art classes, renting old movies and cooking
meals with exotic ingredients.


dingbat
Though Archie Bunker used this word as a form of playful insult, the word really
means a piece of ornamental border, such as a trim of contrasting wallpaper or
a decorative piece of type. Calling someone a dingbat is tantamount to calling
them a bit of decoration.


diphthong
No, it's not a type of sandal. It's a syllable containing two letters used to
make a single sound. For example the ou in sound.


diptych
A painting or relief carving made of two parts, which are usually joined by hinges.
They are invariably small in size and, if an altarpiece, were used for private devotion.
Diptychs are hinged so that they can be closed like a book to protect the interior
paintings.


discreet
Not to be confused with discrete, which is pronounced the same way but spelled
differently. Discreet means being careful about what you say and the way
you act, good at keeping other people's secrets; discrete means separate or
distinct. If you are discreet, you do not talk about your neighbor's affairs.
Grains of flour are not discrete—you can't eat just one—but dinner rolls are.


discursiveness
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discursiveness

disposition effect
Cognitive bias: refers to the irrational tendency among traders in financial
markets to hold on to their losing investments while cutting down the profitable
ones.

Not the opposite of assemble. To give a false or misleading appearance to
something. To lie. Many investigative reporters enjoy asking tough questions to
crooked businesspeople and watching them squirm and dissemble.


dissimulate
A little more subtle than outright lying, it means to pretend that something
is other than it is. If the attorney general asks, "Did your company dump this
toxic waste?" the lying CEO would say, "No." The dissimulating CEO would say,
"What waste?"


dithyramb
A wild and emotional outpouring in speech, song or writing. Naughty children
provoke dithyrambs from their mothers. The tragic portions of operas are
dithyrambs, too.

correct, the word should be used with great care.


doughty
Hearty, brave and courageous (as distinguished from dowdy, which means plain or
unattractive).

The leader or commander; a doyenne if it's a woman. A successful artist might
become the doyenne of the art world and then, if she's hip enough, the doyenne
of the social world.


draconian
Drastic; harsh; inhuman. Cutting off the fingers of pickpockets is considered
by many to be draconian punishment. It dramatically cuts down on recidivism,
however. (See also recidivate.)

have dragooned their victims to get their dubloons.


dulcet
Pleasant; melodious; sweet to the eye or ear. Usually used in conjunction with
the word "tone." A nightingale sings in dulcet tones. (See also mellifluous.)


duplicity
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/duplicity


dyspepsia
Indigestion. When people get indigestion, they are often affected by nausea,
heartburn, and gas-things that can cause the world's greatest gastronome to
curse the world's most delectable dishes. So, it is no wonder that dyspepsia,
a word for indigestion, has also come to mean "ill humor" or "disgruntlement."
The word itself is ultimately derived from the Greek prefix dys- ("faulty"
or "impaired") and the verb pessein ("to cook" or "to digest"). To please the
wordmonger's appetite, we would like to end with this tasty morsel: Dyspepsia
has an opposite, eupepsia-a rarely used word meaning "good digestion."


dystopia
The opposite of a Utopia; a place where everything goes wrong.


e pluribus Unum
The Latin words that comprise the official U. S. motto. They are included in

states.

Sincere and intense conviction. An intense and serious state of mind.


ecce homo
The words of Pilate when presenting Christ to his accusers, the phrase means

uttered; a human echo chamber. Often associated with autism.


ecru
Cream-colored. A little more tan than off-white, but a lot lighter than beige.
Lace curtains are often ecru.


ectomorphic
Literally means "skinny," but the word more accurately describes a personality
type. Abbott was the ectomorph, Costello was the endomorph. Ectomorphs are
generally considered type-A personalities.


ecumenical
Though it has religious implications and is often associated with the Christian
church, the word is used to mean "worldwide" or "universal." An ecumenical
council on hunger would deal with the problem of hunger around the globe.


edacious
Devouring or consuming. Someone with an edacious appetite for books reads all
the time; someone with an edacious appetite for food is probably fat. Don't
confuse with audacious, which means having chutzpah.


effete
Various meanings include sterile and depleted, but the most common usage conveys
decadent, fey or affected. An effete snob is someone who shuns anything remotely
commonplace; an effete person indulges in rare or obscure pleasures.

efficacious
Efficient; effective. It might take a little longer to do a job efficaciously,
but the desired effect is perfectly obtained. Ideal when used to describe
medical treatment.


effluence
A flowing out or streaming forth. The waste that comes from sewage-treatment
plants is effluence. "An effluence of people poured from the stadium when the
ball game was over, creating quite a traffic jam."


effluvium
A bad smell, usually invisible, often associated with waste-treatment
facilities. Bad breath qualifies as effluvium. The smell of apple pie does not.
Say EH-FLU'VEE'UM.


effulge
To shine brightly, both literally and figuratively. A child's face effulges
at the sight of a toy store; the surface of a lake is effulgent in brilliant
sunshine.


egregious
Originally meaning just plain "exceptional," egregious has come to mean not
just bad, but outstand ingly bad. When things are worse than awful, they are
egregious. An egregious error would be calling your present lover by an old
lover's name. Beating child for bad behavior is egregious punishment.


elan
Dash or real style; charisma plus skill. David Niven had elan.


eldritch
Weird, eerie. "His eldritch neighbor continued to leave voodoo dolls all over
his front lawn." A good way for little boys to describe their little sisters.

Charitable or supported by a charity. The United Way is an eleemosynary
institution. Often used in legalese to distinguish from "for-profit."


elephantine
Like an elephant, not in size but in demeanor; embracery lumbering and clumsy.

embayment
A bay. Physical Geography: the process by which a bay is formed.


embrangle
Sounds like a combination of embroil and entangle, and that's more or less
what it means—to confuse or perplex. After hearing both sides of the case,
the judge's understanding of what happened was so embrangled that she couldn't
decide who was guilty.


emeritus

lecture or two. Pronounced EH-MER-IT-US.


eminence
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eminence


eminence grise
The power behind the throne—for example, in the '80s, Nancy Reagan (or even
Nancy Reagan's astrologer). Literally means "gray eminence," if you care.


emolument
Not a skin cream. This is the pay or profit you receive from your job, or more
likely, from a political office. Sometimes used as a nice way to say "kickback."
Say EH-MAHL-YEH-MENT.


empirical

encephalesthenia
Exhaustion due to emotional stress rather than lack of sleep or physical work. A
person who deals with an impending lawsuit by taking naps constantly is probably
suffering from encephalesthenia.


encomium
A eulogy that sums up the good qualities of a dead person. It's come to mean
any ceremonious praise that celebrates a person dead or alive.


encyclical
A letter from the pope to all his bishops. It has come to be used figuratively
to refer to any very important letter. The CEO of a company could send a memo
to all the division heads, who might sarcastically refer to it as the boss's
encyclical.


endemic
Native or indigenous to a region or place. Cypress trees are endemic to the
American South; muggings are endemic to large urban environments.


enervate
Even though this word sounds as if it denotes "to make
nervous," it means the opposite— to weaken or take away the energy. A long
and boring lecture can be very enervating, making an audience fall asleep.


enigma
A puzzling matter that cannot be easily explained; perhaps the most famous use
of the word is to describe the Mona Lisa's smile. A nice way to say that you
have absolutely no idea—"It's an enigma."


ennui
From the French word for "boredom." It means indifferent; bored in a world-
weary sense. The Duke of York suffered from it—too much money, not enough to do.
Pronounced AHN-WEE.


enormity
Contrary to popular belief, the word has nothing to do with size, but with
horribleness or awfulness. The enormity of a situation—like starvation in Africa
— describes the extent of the tragedy.


eonism
A technical way of saying transvestism. A man who dresses in women's clothing
and adopts feminine postures is exhibiting eonism. Pronounced EE-ON-ISM.


ephemera
Something lasting only a short time. Though often used to denote triviality,
ephemera involves time or lifespan, not importance. An earthquake is ephemeral,
as is youth.


epicene
The word has nothing to do with the center of an earthquake; that's an
epicenter. Epicene means reflecting both male and female characteristics;
androgynous. The word has also acquired a secondary meaning as effeminate or
feeble.


epigone
A disciple, not famous in his own right, of a famous writer. If there were a
good example, he wouldn't be a proper epigone because he'd be famous.


epigram
A witty little remark such as: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." Oscar
Wilde was famous for his epigrams. The quotation at the beginning of a book,
which can sometimes be an epigram, is known as an epigraph. Also distinguish
epigram from aphorism, which is a brief, but not necessarily witty, expression.


epiphany
The religious meaning is a Christian feast celebrated on January 6 to
commemorate the appearance of Christ, but the word is also used to mean a sudden
realization of the true meaning of something. The light bulb that appears over
Newton's head in a cartoon demonstrates an epiphany. The light bulb in that
cartoon is also an anachronism (see anachronism).


epistemic
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epistemic


epistemology
The study or a theory of the nature and grounds of knowledge especially with
reference to its limits and validity. The philosophical theory of knowledge. How
we know what we know.


eponymous
Giving one's name to a book, a record or an organization. Lolita is the
eponymous character of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita. The word is frequently used in
record reviews to refer to a hit single whose title is the same as the album on
which it appears.


equable
Uniform; not differing. In an equable distribution, everyone gets the same
amount. Why not say equitable? Because equitable implies fairness. The
distribution might be equal, but it might not be fair.


equivocal
Something that's equivocal has several meanings and is therefore capable of
being interpreted in several ways. Answers that are equivocal are usually
intentionally so; when someone doesn't want to commit himself, he would most
likely give an equivocal answer. More often heard as the antonym, unequivocal,
meaning "leaving no doubt."


ergasiophobia
Fear of, or aversion, to work. What Maynard G. Krebbs suffered in the Dobie
Gillis show.


ergodic
Of or relating to a process in which every sequence or sizable sample is equally
representative of the whole (as in regard to a statistical parameter).


ersatz
Artificial, a substitute for the real thing. Sweet 'n Low is ersatz sugar;
margarine is ersatz butter. Formica can be ersatz marble, wood or any other
number of finishes.


eruct
An extremely erudite way of saying "belch." One way to remember the word is to
think of erupt: "After the very large meal, the man leaned back in his chair and
eructed."


escalation of commitment
Cognitive bias: escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an
individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from a decision, action,
or investment nevertheless continues the behavior instead of altering course. The
actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions
and actions.


eschatology
The branch of theology that is concerned with such final things as death and
Last Judgment; Heaven and Hell; the ultimate destiny of humankind.


eschaton
The final event in the divine plan; the end of the world.


eschew
To avoid or shun something because you find it loathsome or unbearable. One can
eschew on physical grounds, as in eschewing a wool coat in July, or in terms of
taste, as in eschewing displays of physical affection in front of dinner guests.


esprit d'escalier
You probably never knew that there was a word for this—a clever remark or reply
that you didn't think of at the appropriate moment but thought of too late, as
in "I should have said..." It comes from the French phrase, "up the stairs":
"I didn't think of a snappy retort to D'Artagnan until I was already up the
stairs." The next time you find yourself speechless, just say, "When I come
up with the esprit d'escalier, I'll give you a call."


esprit de corps
A feeling of unification or commonly held beliefs or attitudes among a group of
people. The phrase can be used to describe a feeling of excitement and belong-
ng that comes from being part of a successful group. Apple Computer had it for a
while; so did the Peace Corps.


Essentialism
Cognitive bias: the view that every entity has a set of attributes that are
necessary to its identity and function.


etagere
One of those pieces of furniture (often referred to by pompous antiques dealers
and interior decorators) that you feel too embarrassed to admit you've never

sheiks to protect their harem from loyal servants. Now used to describe someone
who acts as if he'd been castrated.


eupepsia
A rarely used word meaning "good digestion."


euphonious
Pleasant to listen to. The word can describe words or music. It's sometimes
confused with cacophonous, which means the opposite.


evanesce
The word sounds like it means "bubbly," but it really means "to fade slowly."
Champagne doesn't evanesce; sunsets do.


exacerbate
To incrementally increase the irritation or annoyance of something, as in:
"Scratching his poison ivy did little but exacerbate the itching."


excogitate
More than just thinking about an issue, to excogitate is to carefully reason it
out.


excoriate
To peel or take the skin from. The word is generally used figuratively. You peel
an apple, but you excoriate someone for screwing up.


exculpate
To free from blame. Exculpation doesn't mean forgiveness; it means that you
were never guilty to begin with, and now your name is cleared.


exigency
An unexpected set of circumstances—but not synonymous with emergency. Urgent
needs or demands arising from a set of circumstances. "I will definitely not
raise taxes and positively not cut Social Security. Unless, of course, an
exigency arises."


existential
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/existential


exordium
A more precise way to describe the introduction to a speech, presentation or
book. Readers (such as yourself?) often skip over the preface, but they'll
certainly spend the time to read the exordium if it is clearly labeled.


exoteric
Appropriate for general consumption. A lovely twist on the commonly used
esoteric. If goat cheese is esoteric, then cheddar is exoteric.


expatiate
To expand upon, as in a speech that goes on to explain the causes and symptoms
of an event. (Not to be confused with people who emigrate to a foreign land).


expeditious
Quick and speedy in the sense of "most rapidly accomplished." An expeditious
solution to feeling nauseatingly drunk is to pass out.


extirpate
To uproot or completely destroy. An earthquake may extirpate a small village.


fabulist
A liar. If you want to accuse someone of not telling you the truth without
instantaneously enraging them, call them a fabulist. It sounds gentler.


facetious
Flippant. When a tourist asks, "How do you get to Carnegie Hall?" the facetious
New Yorker answers, "Practice, practice, practice."


facinorous
Exceptionally evil or wicked. Not just the Witch of the West; more along the
lines of Satan.


fakir

of nails.


fallal
A showy ornament especially in dress; costume jewelry or cheap, flashy trimmings
on clothing.


false memory

not happen or differently from the way it happened.


farinaceous
Made from flour or meal and containing a lot of starch, such as bread, pasta
or cereal. Vegetarians frequently eat farinaceous meals.


farrago
Not a dance—that's a fandango. A farrago is a jumbled hodgepodge, a mixture.
If you haven't cleaned your closet in years, it's likely to be filled with a
farrago of old winter coats, dirty socks, deflated balls and lonesome single
shoes.


fastuous
Overbearingly snotty, pretentious, or arrogant. Not to be confused with fatuous
(see fatuous), although fastuous people can be fatuous. Be kind to the fastuous
among us, because they certainly suffer from low self-esteem.


fatuous
Foolish or inane. Clowns aren't fatuous, they're silly. A boorish drunk or a
fawning suitor can easily become fatuous, however.


faux pas
From the French for "false step." This is a wonderful word for a social blunder,
an error of etiquette. If you pronounce your boss's name incorrectly while
introducing his speech at a large convention, you have committed a faux pas.


feral
Animalistic; existing in a wild state. With his ripped shirt and slight drool,
Robert seemed almost feral.


filtrum
That little canal that leads from your nose to your mouth. You knew there was a
name for it, and now you know what it is.


flaccid
Limp or flabby, like the stems of wilted flowers or the thighs of people who eat
too much and don't exercise.


flaneur
A word that comes from the French and means "idler" or "loafer," such as someone
who sits around all day eating croissants and smoking Gauloises and not doing
much of anything else. Not the ideal mate.


fletcher
A person who makes arrows. There's not much use for this word today, but you
never know when you might run into Robin Hood and need some ammunition.


flocculant
A chemical for producing flocculation of suspended particles, as to improve the
plasticity of clay for ceramic purposes.


florid
The word has two equally used meanings: "rosy or ruddy" and also "flowery or
elaborate." The man with the florid complexion sitting behind the bar com-posed
a poem in florid language about the woman he loves.


floromancy
The belief that flowers have feelings and will respond to the way they are
treated. People who talk to their plants and play music for them to help them
grow most certainly believe in floromancy.


flotsam
Flotsam is the floating remains of a sunken or wrecked ship. Jetsam is the
floating stuff purposely thrown overboard to keep a ship from sinking in the
first place. In our modern age, the two words are generally used together, as
in, "This antique store carries a collection of the flotsam and jetsam of our
society."


flout
To mock or show contempt: "The student flouted university rules by coming to
class naked to the waist." It is important to distinguish flout from flaunt.
Haunt is slightly more positive. You can flaunt wealth by wearing a diamond
bracelet to play tennis, for example. Flout rhymes with doubt.


flubdub
You could also say claptrap, or bunkum. But there are times when only flubdub is
adequate to describe a ridiculous, poorly-thought-out, bombastic argument.


flump
To drop with a heavy thud. Sort of the noise you make when you collapse
in a chair or throw the laundry on the bed. Talk about onomatopoeia (see
onomatopoeia)!


foozle
To bungle or goof up. Not recommended in referring to truly serious goof-ups,
like erasing your hard disk. Better for describing the acts of a waiter who
brings every single person the wrong dish at dinner. It's one of those words
that makes you smile every time you use it.


foray
An attack or raid. Though the word has a military connotation, it is often used
metaphorically. One can make a foray into astrophysics by buying a basic text
and trying to understand the principles.


forer effect
Cognitive bias: also called Barnum Effect, is the phenomenon that occurs
when individuals believe that personality descriptions apply specifically to
them (more so than to other people), despite the fact that the description is
actually filled with information that applies to everyone.


forte
Has two meanings, though only one appears in everyday conversation. In classical
music, forte means "play this loudly!" It's pronounced FOUR-TAY since the word
comes from the Italian. However, the usual meaning of forte is "strong point"
as in, "Bad decisions are his forte" or "Cooking Cajun food is my forte." But if
you want to sound smart, be sure to say the word correctly.


fortuitous
Depending on luck or chance; accidental. Fortuitous circumstances may help you
to win some money, but they can also cause you to lose a bet. Don't use the word
to convey only good luck—it describes things that are up to chance, good or bad.


founder
To be wrecked and to sink. Mostly it's ships that founder, but you could use the
word figuratively. Many people foundered in the stock market on Black Monday,
for example. The word is often confused with flounder, which in addition to
being a fish, means "to move clumsily."


fractious
Irritable, whiny, quarrelsome and rebellious, a word that best applies to the
behavior of children or to adults who are acting like children.


friable
The condition of being friable, describes the tendency of a solid substance to
break into smaller pieces under duress or contact, especially by rubbing. The
opposite of friable is indurate.


frisson
A shiver, as from a thrill or a fright. A frisson passes through an audience
watching the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The word is best used as
a reaction to situations that intend to scare, such as roller coaster rides or
horror films. It's actually a nice way to say goosebumps.


fulgent
Very bright; shining or radiant. A good word for describing things like the
spaceship in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or the full moon.


fulgurant
Flashing like lightning.


fulsome
The word originally meant "disgustingly excessive" or "copious." It has evolved
to connote disgusting, tasteless and generally repellent. It's often confused
to mean the opposite. A fulsome beauty exceeds the bounds of moderation and
is probably not pretty at all. It's a good word to use when you want to insult
someone covertly.


fungible
Easily interchangeable with something else; the opposite of unique. One loaf
of bread is fungible with another. In a recession, some employers find certain
employees fungible.


gaffe
A social blunder, just like a faux pas (see faux pas). If you meet the president
and call him Your Royal Highness, that's a gaffe.


gainsay
To contradict what another person says, as in: "I gainsay your insistence that
she is brilliant; in fact, I don't find her smart at all."


galactoid
This is a nice word because the word has nothing to do with outer space—it means
"milk-like." The only overlap in the intended and misused meanings then would be
the Milky Way. Coffee creamers are galactoid. So is the blood of many insects.


garrulous
Excessively talkative in a silly, chattering way. Often misused to mean just
plain friendly and willing to talk, which is loquacious. Save garrulous to
describe relatives who call frequently and make it impossible to get off the
telephone no matter how hard you try.


gatefold
This is a large page, folded and bound into a book or magazine. Examples are
those expensive car or perfume advertisements in magazines or, most frequently,
the maps included in certain books. The centerfold in Playboy is, as it sounds,
a centrally located gatefold.


gelid
A word for icy or frozen. It is rarely used figuratively. A haughty woman might
have an icy stare, but gelid should be reserved for lakes in the winter or
desserts offered by street vendors in the summer.


genre
Category. Similar items belong to the same genre. Science fiction is a genre of
literature.


germane
Another way of saying relevant, pertinent or appropriate, but strictly
reserved for referring to ideas. You couldn't say that wearing a certain
pair of shoes is germane to a particular set of clothes. The topic of sexual
harassment is germane to a discussion about rights in the workplace, however.
In a conversation about classical music, James Brown is probably not germane.
Pronounced JERM-AJN.


gerrymander
The reorganization of the electoral districts of a state to give one political
party an advantage.


gestalt
The word comes from a school of psychology, but has come to mean a way of
describing the big picture of a situation. Add together all the pieces and sum
them up in a feeling. This feeling can range from the complicated way our brain
solves problems to the combination of smells, feelings and sensations you get
during a massage.


gild
To coat with gold. When used figuratively, as in "gilding the lily," gild means
adding refinement or ornamentation to something that doesn't need it.


gimme caps
The ubiquitous baseball-style caps that bear various logos in front are called
gimme caps. The word is said to come from farmers who are fond of asking tractor
salesmen wearing these caps with their company name, "Gimme one of those caps."


glean
To gather or absorb information. You can glean information on nuclear weapons by
reading secret plans, or glean a bit about an executive's personality by the way
she shakes hands. Rhymes with clean.


gobbet
Another way of saying morsel or lump, as in: "Please put a gobbet of whipped
cream on top of my pecan pie."


googol
The number 1, followed by 100 zeros. This is the biggest number with a name (not
counting the googolplex, which is cheating). It might be nice to offer someone
you love a googol kisses.


Gordian knot
An apparently unsolvable problem. Alexander (before he was the Great) was
presented with a rope containing a huge knot, and told that the first man to
untie it would rule Europe. He took out his sword and cut it in half. The word
is commonly used to describe any complex problem begging for a drastic solution.


gossamer
Originally a cobweb, now the word describes any translucent, wispy object. The
Gossamer Albatross was the first pedal-powered aircraft—so named because of its
fragile gossamer wings.


gracile
Slender and graceful, such as a fawn, a gazelle or a ballet dancer.


grammalogue
This is the word for any sign or letter which signifies a word, such as &.
(and), $ (dollars) or @ (at).


grand guignol
Connoting a drama with strains of horror. It's the kind of word people like to
use metaphorically. A difficult divorce or the cruel way someone was fired from
a job might be described as a grand guignol.


grandiloquent
A lofty, extravagantly colorful, pompous, or bombastic style, manner, or quality
especially in language.


gregarious
Friendly. Occasionally used to imply insincerity, gregarious should be reserved
for those that are truly outgoing and friendly. Rhymes with precarious.


griffin
A mythical beast with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle.
Not the sort of animal you'd want to see flying over your Miata if the top were
down.


grimalkin
It sounds like some form of medieval clothing, perhaps a vest for holding
arrows, but it means an old female cat. A nice way to affectionately refer to
one's pet.


grommet
A small, metal-reinforced hole, especially in a sail or other piece of canvas.
Used to attach ropes or other tie-downs.


grum
Like it sounds: grim, glum or surly. It's got a nice undertone of grumpy that
comes across with the pronunciation. If your car breaks down on the third lap of
the Indy 500, you have the right to act grum.


gudgeon
An easy mark, someone who is duped without effort. The guys who play three-card
monte on the street are just waiting for a gudgeon to come along so they can
beat him and make a quick twenty bucks. Though the word sounds a bit archaic, it
has a nice lumbering sound. Also a metal pivot—see pintle.


gullible
Often misused, this isn't really a word. It's not in the dictionary. (Got ya'!
Sorry, but we couldn't resist!)


gunkhole
Though it sounds like a noun, this word is really a verb which means to sail
slowly along a coastline, stopping along the way in quiet ports. To gunkhole
down the East Coast to the Florida Keys would make a very relaxing vacation,
provided you're not the type who gets seasick.


gunwale
The top of the side of a boat (where the rail might be). Especially used in
referring to small boats such as canoes. Originally used to describe the place
where you'd rest your gun (probably for shooting fish, or some other sporting
activity).


gustatory
Tasting. A gustatory menu in a fancy restaurant allows you to try lots of
different dishes.


gynarchy
Government by a woman or by women. Not to be confused with matriarchy, which
refers to a family or tribe headed by women. Until recently, Great Britain was a
gynarchy.


hajj

figuratively to refer to any pilgrimage. Many senior citizens make their annual
hajj to Florida in the winter, for example.


halcyon
The word derives from an ancient fabled bird that bred during the winter
solstice and charmed the winds and seas, calming them during that period. It
has simply come to mean calm, tranquil, and happy. People often refer to "the
halcyon days" when they are feeling nostalgic about an easier or more prosperous
time in their lives.


halidom
A holy place, thing, or sanctuary, such as a chapel or church. Halidome can also
be spelled with an e on the end.

meant to bring good luck, such as a bottle of champagne to the owner of a new
restaurant.


haptics
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/haptics

A person, thing or event that foreshadows the arrival of something. The first
robin is a harbinger of spring; the sight of billboards for hundreds of miles is
a harbinger of Wall Drug in South Dakota.

grade history teacher, a nasty neighbor or the wicked witch in a fairy tale.
Pronounced HA-RIH-DEN.

entrails. What a great word to describe a trend analyst who doesn't know what
he's talking about.


haughty
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/haughty


havelock
A cloth covering for a cap which has a flap to protect the back of the neck
from the sun—the kind of thing Lawrence of Arabia wore. Players on outdoor urban
basketball courts wear havelocks today.


hedonist
A person addicted to things that give pleasure or happiness. A hedonist puts
chocolate ice cream and hot fudge on a flourless chocolate cake, or spends class
time sunbathing while attending the University of Miami.

economic leadership, as in one country over another or one state over another.
Japan has hegemony over the United States in the consumer electronics industry.
Pronounced HEH- J EM-EN-EE.


hegira
A flight or escape from one situation to another that offers better
circumstances. It often refers to the flight of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina in

provides better pay and more interesting work.


heliotrope
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heliotrope


hermaphrodite
This is a human being or an animal that has both male and female sex organs. Do
not confuse with an androgyne, someone who exhibits both male and female sexual
manners and traits. There are many androgynous people in the world, but very
few hermaphrodites.


heterodox
A person or a belief that is not in accordance with established orthodox belief.
Heterodox is generally used to refer to religion but can be used more broadly.
For example, a Catholic who maintains heterodox beliefs may support the abortion
movement. A professor at a conservative university who has heterodox ideas
may cancel all classes in favor of life experience internships and private
conferences. Pronounced HETT-ERR-OH-DOX. heteronym A word spelled like another,
but with a different sound and meaning, such as lead and lead, read and read.
Pronounced HET-ERR-OH-NIM.


heuristic
The hints, techniques and concepts we use to make decisions. How does a doctor
decide what drug to prescribe? Why did you pick a blue shirt instead of a red
one? An important concept, because understanding the heuristics that we use to
make a decision can help us learn how to do it better.


hiatus
A break in a career or routine. Optimistic TV producers talk about a show going
on hiatus, when they really mean that it has been canceled.
highbinder
This is a word for swindler or confidence man. It's a particularly nice word
because you can accuse someone of being a highbinder without insulting him—he
probably won't know what the word means! (See also gudgeon.) Hairy. A man in
need of a shave is hirsute. You hirsute would not describe a sticky or hairy
situation as hirsute.


histrionic
Overly dramatic; so excessively theatrical as to be unbelievable. A teenager
who sobbingly declares that he will die if he is cut from the tennis team is
engaging in histrionics.


hoary
Gray- or white-haired with age. There is no insult in this word. Old Man Time
has a hoary beard. Santa Claus does, too. Rhymes with story.


Hobson's choice
Thomas Hobson was not a philosopher, but a 16th- 17th century English stable
owner who insisted that his clients take the horse closest to the door. The
phrase, named after Hobson, means a decision that offers no alternative. In
short—take it or leave it.


hoi polloi
People often use this word to mean the fancy people in a society, but it means
the opposite. The hoi polloi are the common people, the vulgar masses whom Marie
Antoinette dismissed by suggesting that they eat cake.


homeopathy
Though the word has come to be used to mean natural medicine, such as ginseng
or flower therapy, as opposed to pharmaceuticals, it means treating disease by
administering minute doses of drugs that normally produce symptoms like those of
the disease.


homily
A sermon or a moral lecture. Priests deliver homilies on living morally; coaches
deliver homilies on living cleanly; parents often deliver homilies on both.


homunculus
Literally meaning "little man," this word can be used to refer to anybody
who's more than 20 years old and less than five feet tall, but the word is
more commonly used figuratively to mean "the little man inside the box making
decisions." Often used in philosophy as a slick way to describe consciousness
or computers. Your mind is nothing more than a skull with a homunculus inside,
making the decisions (who's inside the homunculus? another homunculus!).


honorarium
A token payment made for professional services, generally less than should be
charged. When a congressman gives a speech, the conference organizers don't
degrade him by paying him—they give him an honorarium.


hoodoo
A nice folksy way of saying bad luck; kind of like voodoo with a vengeance. He
suffered a bolt of hoodoo last month when he lost his job, cracked up his car,
and misplaced his dry-cleaning ticket.

effort to convince the boys to join the army.


nosce hostem

to violence. There's some generosity in the insult; it's kinder than calling
someone a homicidal maniac.


https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imperative


hubris
Excessive pride; proud to a fault. Originally used to describe the flaw of mere
mortals who challenged the gods. Icarus was guilty of hubris, as is Donald Trump

understanding demonstrated by the participants.

who is often cheap and miserly. Scrooge was a hunks before he met his ghosts.


hyperbole
An intentionally exaggerated exaggeration, not meant to be taken literally.
"You're the nicest person I've ever met" might be an exaggeration, but "You're
the nicest person in the whole wide world" is a hyperbole.
hypernym
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypernym


hypocorism
A word for baby talk like "kitchee, kitchee, koo," or for pet names like

The sad situation of getting sicker after treatment by a doctor. Lately expanded

goes into a hospital to be treated for a broken leg and then catches a bad virus
from the person in the neighboring bed suffers from the iatrogenic conditions
common to many hospitals.


ichthyoid
This is a scientific word for "fish-like." Some underwater creatures are
ichthyoid; so are the handshakes of certain disagreeable people.


iconoclast
Someone who attacks traditional or popular values, beliefs or symbols of
traditional values. The man carrying the "God is Dead" sign is an iconoclast,
as is a politician who attacks beloved TV stars. Along with hubris (see hubris),
this word belongs in your everyday vocabulary.


iconography
Pictorial or symbolic representation of something. Cave writings depict ancient
cultures by telling stories through pictures; in the same way, urban graffiti
often provides the iconography for contemporary urban street culture.


idem
The Latin word for "ditto." (Not those blue-printed papers you used to sniff
in elementary school.) Ditto means "repeat that last item again." Some people
prefer to use idem rather than ditto, abbreviated to id. in scholarly works.


idiogamist
A man who is capable of engaging in sexual intercourse only with his wife.


idioglossia
This is the word for the invented, unintelligible form of speech shared by
twins, siblings or any children who are closely associated. You could probably
extend the definition to describe intense technical discussions between computer
whizzes, or the shorthand used by waiters at a short-order lunch counter.


idiograph
This is not the writing of a stupid person, but rather the word for any private
trademark or signature. A common idiograph among teenage girls is to dot the i's
in their names with a heart.


idiopathy
A disease not preceded or occasioned by any known morbid condition.


ignoble
It basically means the opposite of "noble"—mean, contemptible and of generally
low character. Taking credit for someone else's work is an ignoble act, as is

duking it out at home plate, or a skirmish among many factions on Capitol Hill.
The correct pronunciation is IM-BROHL-YOH (don't pronounce the g).

To enclose within walls; cloister; incarcerate; to shut in; seclude or confine;
to imprison; to build into or entomb in a wall; to surround with walls; fortify.


impecunious

unavoidable: "It is imperative that we leave."  It also means commanding. As a
noun, imperative means a command; something that demands attention or action; an
unavoidable obligation or requirement; necessity: "It is an imperative that we
help defend friendly nations."


impertinence
The quality or state of being impertinent: such as incivility, insolence,
inappropriateness


implacable
Not to be pleased, convinced or reconciled. Implacable carries with it more
class than stubborn.


importune
To beg or plead with great intensity and persistence. A child might beg her
mother to let her stay up late; a man might importune his wife not to leave him.
Choose importune when the importance of the plea is great enough to merit the
word.

attribution of particular qualities to a member of a certain social group.


imprimatur

them; he just endorses them with his name.


impudence
A contemptuous or cocky boldness, or disregard of others; impertinet; insolent.

away with it; if you do it without impunity, you know you'll be in deep trouble—
and you're not using the word correctly either.


in extremis
The Latin expression for "near death." When a person on his deathbed makes a
sudden decision, such as to change his will and leave everything to a distant
cousin, his decision is said to have been made in extremis. The word is often
misused to mean a state of near insanity, since things that are decided in
extremis are by their very nature, well, extreme.


in flagrante delicto
An evocative Latin phrase for being caught in the middle of a sexual act. A wife
leaves work early and comes home to find her husband in flagrante delicto with
another woman. (Sexual infidelity must have been common in Roman times, too.)

spirit that badgers women for sexual favors. A better way to say you didn't have
a very good night's sleep.


inculpate
The opposite of exculpate; to blame, more in a legal sense than a moral one.
Thieves and murderers are inculpated by society; parents are blamed when their
children misbehave. Don't confuse the word with inculcate, which means to teach
by constant repetition.


indefectible
Perfect; without flaw or defect. It can be used to describe a person's
character, as well as a perfect diamond or a work of art.


indemnity

damages that may occur because of your actions. For movie buffs, double
indemnity is an insurance phrase for a double pay-off in certain instances—
murder, for example.


ineffable
Indescribable, impossible to capture in words. Usually used for things that are
indescribably good or too mysterious or spiritual to put into words. A Mounds
bar is not ineffable, but the beauty of nature may be.


infamous
This doesn't mean "not famous." Infamous describes a famous person whose fame is
based on unsavory acts. Serial killers and hardened criminals are infamous, as
are most dictators. Pronounced /N-FEH-MUSS. inflammable Just like flammable, but
the word is longer. Both types of objects will burst into flames when lit. No
one really knows the difference.


ingenue
A naive young woman or, just as common, an actress who plays the role of a naive
young woman. Marilyn Monroe made the type famous.


ingenuous
Not ingenious, nor disingenuous. Ingenuous means naive and unworldly. (Ingenious
means clever. Disingenuous means pretending to be innocent and naive.) "His big
brown eyes and charming, ingenuous grin made him very likeable."


inimical
Often confused with inimitable (which means impossible to imitate), inimical
means hostile and unfriendly. An inimical rival should be avoided, not because
he's in a class by himself but because he's downright vicious.


iniquity

innervate

stimulate or furnish with nervous energy. Some things can be enervating and
innervating at the same time, such as spending several hours with a group of
raucous kids.


inscrutable
Mysterious; difficult to understand or fully grasp. A great catch-all word
that can be applied to people, ideas, written works or life in general.
Obscure philosophers are inscrutable; shy people who don't talk much are often
inscrutable.


insouciance
Indifference, but with a subtle twist of devil-maycare. An apathetic person may
be simply indifferent to what's going on; a person who intentionally acts as if
she doesn't care in order to look cool or invulnerable is showing insouciance.


intense

characteristic in extreme degree. Marked by or expressive of great zeal, energy,
determination, or concentration. Exhibiting strong feeling or earnestness of
purpose. Deeply felt.


intents and purposes
Usually used in the phrase "for all intents and purposes," it means under usual
circumstances or during normal conditions: For all intents and purposes, a
seat belt increases the safety of the driver. Not intensive purposes, a common
mistake.


interdict
To forbid or sternly prohibit. It's best used with official pronouncements.
A key word in the war against drugs, usually accomplished by the Coast Guard.


interjacent
In between, unlike adjacent, which means next to. Most often used in
mathematical discussions, but can be applied in everyday speech, as in: "They
took a hotel room that was interjacent to the rooms of their friends so they
could intercede if a fight broke out."


internecine
Since the word is almost always used in conjunction with "warfare," it has come
to be misunderstood to mean "nuclear." In fact, it means "mutually destructive."
A divorce can be internecine, so can squabbling among divisions of a company.
Pronounced IN-TER-NESS-EEN.


intestate
Dying without a will. In many states, this costs your heirs lots of money. For
some reason, many Americans believe that creating a will somehow encourages an
early visit from the Grim Reaper.


intort
Kind of like contort, but neater. When you twist or curl something around a
fixed point, you intort it. Pretzels could be described this way, complicated
logic probably not.


intractable
Stubborn or obstinate, such as a child who won't behave even after being
scolded.


intransigent
Like intractable (see above) but with more intensity, the word means stubborn,
obstinate, refusing to compromise or change an opinion or belief. It implies
a bit of ideological commitment that adds to the refusal to change, as in:
"The employees demonstrated in front of the building to demand better working
conditions, but the management remained intransigent..


inure
To become hardened and unaffected by hardship, difficulty or attack. The boy
was teased so often for being shorter than his classmates that after a while
he became inured to the taunting words and tried out for the basketball team.


invective
Although this word sounds as if it should be an adjective, it's a noun that
means "strongly abusive verbal criticism." Ship captains are well known for
using invective to motivate their sailors.


invidious
Of an unpleasant or objectionable nature. Like obnoxious invidious remarks.
Also: of a kind to cause harm or resentment. An invidious comparison. Tending to
cause discontent, animosity, or envy.

for anybody or anything, and flies off the handle at the slightest provocation.
Often associated with cantankerous old men.


irenic
Peaceful, calm and capable of inducing serenity. Save this word to refer to
personalities rather than things. Lakes are placid; people who meditate are said
to be irenic.


iterate
It means the same thing as reiterate: to repeat over and over. Use reiterate if
you want people to understand what you're saying; save iterate for describing
learning by doing something over and over again, getting better or more accurate
each time. That's called an iterative process. An iteration describes one of the
repetitions.


jape
This is a nice word because it's both a noun and a verb. To joke or to tease;
also a taunt, wisecrack or practical joke. "He continued to jape me over my new
glasses." "I opened the door and a huge bowl of Jell-O fell on my head—quite
a jape!"


jejune
This word has nothing to do with the month in which everyone gets married. It
means dull and uninteresting, immature and lacking in wisdom. Adolescents are
notorious for being considered jejune by adults and for considering everybody,
adults included, jejune.


jerry-built
Held together with toothpicks and glue; shoddily built or slapped together. Very
similar to jury-rig, which implies something built hastily with whatever was at
hand. "He jury-rigged a contraption to automatically rock the cradle, but since
it was jerry-built, it collapsed."


jettison
To throw overboard. Jetsam (see flotsam) is jettisoned all the time.


jihad
The word literally means a holy war waged by Muslims as a religious duty, but
it has come to be used for any cause undertaken on behalf of certain principles.

or symbols. Jingoism has something of a negative connotation because it suggests
unreasonable excess. Often associated with xenophobia (see xenophobia), which is
the fear of foreigners.

describes someone who's always talking.


jodhpurs

wide thighs and narrow calves. Dudley DoRight wears a pair. Named after a city
in western India, in case you were curious.

are called joeys, just as all baby bears are called cubs.

Carl Jung was a contemporary and follower of Freud, and is best known for his
theories of a universal mythology, a connection that brings us all back to basic
roots. If you believe in this stuff, you're Jungian.


juvenescent
Youthful. It has no negative connotation like immature or naive; it literally
means "young." Plants are juvenescent in the seedling stage; the moon is
juvenescent when it first begins to wax.


juxtapose
This is one of those words people love to use to sound smart, particularly when
criticizing art, fiction or films. The word means to put next to something else
for comparison. You can juxtapose the letters on the Scrabble board to score
more points.


Kafkaesque
A reference to the early 20th-century novels of Franz Kafka, whose surreal,
nightmarish plots revolve around protagonists who are caught in a strangling
web of bureaucracy. Now applied to any event in which a person is trapped by
stultifying bureaucratic measures.


kakistocracy
A wonderfully descriptive word, often needed and rarely recognized, that means
"government by the worst people in the state."


katabatic
Moving down a slope or valley. Skiing is clearly a katabatic sport.


kef
The word refers to a drowsy, dreamy state induced by a narcotic, such as
marijuana, but can be used to mean a stupor brought about by anything. A dull
speaker can put his audience in a kef; traveling by car on a long turnpike can
do the same thing.


kegler
It sounds like a kegler might be a person who drinks a lot of beer, but in fact
it's a person who bowls, such as Ralph Kramden of "The Honeymooners." So, it may
in fact be a person who drinks a lot of beer.


ken
Area of expertise or authority. '"That's outside my ken,' said the detective."
Rhymes with Ken.


kente
A type of African cloth. Developed hundreds of years ago, kente cloth is a sign

The opposite of "the life of the party." Your dour friend who is always pointing
out the risks, the dangers and the downsides is a killjoy. Kids call him or her
a spoilsport.

motion.


kiosk

information.


kismet

you refer to them as your kith and kin.


knave

of funeral bells ringing. Almost always coupled with "death." For instance,
"Videocassettes sounded the death knell for revival movie houses."


knurl
A series of small ridges, such as those found along the edge of a quarter. It's
a good word to know if you need to explain any magic tricks that involve coins.

To bow before someone. Though it can mean bowing in a gesture of genuine
respect, as it did when the word was coined by the Chinese, it has come to mean
groveling or currying favor.


krotoscope
Remember those old dance shows on TV when prizes were awarded to the contestant
who earned the most applause? The device used to measure applause is a
krotoscope. Probably developed in some secret government lab.


kudos
Not a method of self-defense, or a brand of chocolate bar, but applause or
praise. Critics extend kudos to playwrights.


labile
Although the word means unstable in general, it is most frequently used to mean
emotionally unstable, as in temperamental or moody. A child who cries at the
slightest provocation is labile; an adult who laughs too loudly at a joke and
then sinks suddenly into depression is also labile. Labile people generally make
others uncomfortable, since every reaction comes across like an overreaction.
Pronounce it like label.


lachrymose
Given to weeping. It has less to do with being sad than it does with shedding
tears. The movies that we call tear-jerkers make us cry because they are sad.
Eyedrops, air pollution or a bitter wind can make us lachrymose.


lackey
Servant. Someone who does menial tasks or runs errands for another. A servile
follower.


lacuna
A lacuna is a rather elegant way of describing a gap or a missing portion. The
most famous lacuna of all is the 18- minute gap in the Watergate tapes. If you
borrow a book from a careless friend and the middle fifty pages are missing,
you might call to ask what happened in the lacuna.


lambent
Dealing gently but brilliantly with a subject, or touching something lightly
and playfully on the surface. Intelligent criticism of a work of art might be
considered lambent; fiction dealing broadly but cleverly with society's ills is
lambent. On the more literal side, a poet might describe the lambent sunlight
playing on the surface of a stream.


lanai
Hotel jargon for a private terrace or balcony that comes with a room.


languor
Weakness or weariness of body or mind. Also Listless indolence or inertia.

things in windy places.


legerdemain
A particularly elegant way of saying dexterity in the use of one's hands to
perform magic tricks, juggling, or other feats of deception. The word might
be used more wryly, as in "That creative accountant's tax work was a feat of
legerdemain."


leitmotif
A theme maintained throughout a body of work, particularly a musical work,
associated with a character, an idea or an emotion.


lethologica
A temporary inability to remember a word or a name; the condition that makes
you screw up your face and say, "Ooh...it's on the tip of my tongue." The next
time a friend forgets a word, here's hoping you don't say, "Oh, there's a word
for that condition. It's called...ooh...I forget."

This word refers to the working or usable vocabulary of a language, a person or
a culture. After reading this book, your lexicon should be greatly expanded.


libertarian
An advocate of liberty of thought and action. Also refers to a political party
which supports minimal gov-ernment intervention, except in law and military
defense.


libertine
Not to be confused with a libertarian (see above), a libertine is someone who
advocates the liberty to be dissolute, particularly with regard to sexual needs.
A libertine, like a rake or a roue (see roue) seeks to satisfy personal lust at
just about any cost. Don Juan was a libertine.


licentious
A licentious person is a libertine (see above); someone uncontrolled in sexual
indulgence.


lickerish
Lustful and lecherous. (See licentious above.)

Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, these people are about three inches tall. A
fancy way to say "small." (See also yahoo.)

emotional responses, especially when it comes to behaviours we need for
survival: feeding, reproduction and caring for our young, and fight or flight
responses.

of eliciting a response. Example: a liminal visual stimuli.  Also of, relating to,
or being an intermediate state, phase, or condition : in-between, transitional.

or in words. A poet may limn the beauty of a sunset in rhyming couplets; an
artist may limn the beauty of a person or an object using clay or watercolors or
shards of pottery, for that matter.


limpid
This is one of those words you're sure you know the meaning of—droopy, limp,
flaccid (see flaccid), right? Wrong. In fact, limpid means clear or transparent.
A country stream is limpid; Elizabeth Taylor's eyes are limpid—even unpolluted
air could be described as limpid.


linchpin
A lot like a cotter pin. Traditionally, a piece of hardware that holds together
a piece of machinery, now used to describe the crucial element in an argument
or organization.


lingua franca
Sounds like a pasta dish, but it's not. The phrase describes a common language—
a good way to break the ice in a difficult negotiation. When people talk sports,
they are engaging in a lingua franca. Say it like it looks: LING-WAH FRANK-AH.


lissom
Supple; agile; lithe. Ballet dancers are lissom. Olympic athletes are lissom.
Michael Jordan is lissom, even when he's just walking down the street. Sometimes

litotes
Someone who speaks in litotes uses understatements in which two negatives make
a positive. "She's not a bad actress" is a litotes; so is "You're not looking
half- bad."

A word used to describe people who have personalities not unlike the taste of
liver—if you don't like liver. A liverish person is unpleasant, disagreeable,
easily irritated and generally icky to be around.


livery
The clothing or uniform worn by the servants of highranking people. A
chauffeur's suit and cap is his livery; the crewcut, sunglasses, dark suit

facetiously to refer to any uniform. Black leather, spiky hair and lots of
earrings is the livery of the punk scene, for example.


livid
The word literally means the color of flesh after being strangled—bluish-gray
—but most of the time it's used to describe furious anger, as in choking with
anger. If you arrive a half-hour late for a meeting with someone who hates to
be kept waiting, you're likely to find that the person you are meeting is either
livid or not there.


logophobia
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logophobia


logorrhea
Not a bad case of indigestion, but close. The word basically means diarrhea of
the mouth. When you meet someone who makes you nervous and you begin to chatter

and some people suffer it permanently.


looby
An awkward person, especially one who is lazy or stupid; lout; lubber.


loquacious
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/loquacious


Lothario
A silly, stupid person—a novel twist on boob. A reference to a character in an
18th-century play by Rowe, this is a man who charms women and lies to them in
order to gain sexual favors, not unlike a rake, a roue (see roue), a libertine
(see libertine), or a licentious (see licentious) man.


lothario
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lothario


louche
Decadent, depraved, seedy and immoral. The streets of Saigon during the Viet Nam
war were louche; certain bars along the waterfront in port cities are louche.
You can use the word to describe a person's character, but it's better used to
capture an atmosphere.


loup
A half-mask, the kind that covers only the eyes and nose. Batman and Catwoman
favor them, although theirs are clearly more elaborate than the average loup.
Rhymes with soup.


lubricious
You can pronounce it LOO-BRIK-US or LOO-BRISH-US, and either way it means
slippery in a literal sense (as in lubricated), or slippery in a more figurative
sense (lecherous, lascivious or licentious). Rakes, roues, Lotharios (see above)
are all lubricious; so is a newly waxed floor or a well-oiled hinge.


lubricous
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lubricous


lucubrate
To burn the midnight oil—to work or study late into the night. The home office
and the personal computer have made lucubration far easier.
lugubrious
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lugubrious

"lumpen proletariat." It means people deprived of their rights and homes, or
otherwise degraded in social standing.

means not very subtle. Lurid colors are exceptionally bright; lurid clothes are
gaudy or revealing; lurid language is probably peppered with violent or sexual
references; lurid dancing is sexually suggestive. It's not necessarily bad,
just blatant.


lysophobia
means a morbid dread of going insane.


macedoine
Not a citizen of Macedonia. This is the kind of word you see on the menus
of fancy restaurants that offer things like medaillons of beef or chicken en
crotite. It means diced and mixed. A macedoine of fruit is nothing more or
less than a fruit cocktail. But it sounds much more exotic, doesn't it? It's
pronounced MASS-EH'DWAN.


machination
This word really rolls off the tongue. It means a secret plot or scheme and
has a particularly sneaky and underhanded tone. Competitive coworkers often get
involved in machinations to move up in the office hierarchy.
macroeconomics
The study of the broad and general aspects of an economy, such as the general
level of inflation, rather than of a particular aspect of a society's economy
(see microeconomics).


madrilene
Sounds like an 18th-century dance step or a pretentious name for a little girl,
but it's neither. In fact, it's a kind of soup—tomato-flavored broth, served
jellied and cold or liquid and hot. At least you now know whether you want to
order some next time you're having a mac6doine of fruit (see macedoine). Say
MAD-REE-LEN.


magna cum laude
Get it straight: summa cum laude is the highest praise and it means just that;
magna cum laude is the next highest and means with great praise; cum laude is
the lowest of three honors and it means, simply, with honor. If you graduate
with any of the three you're doing just great.


magniloquent
If you call someone magniloquent, it's not a compliment. It means boastful,
pompous, and full of hot air—a great way to insult a magniloquent person.


maillot

piece swimsuits. It's come to denote any one-piece swimsuit, regardless of the

"Beware the ideas of March." "It's not the heat; it's the humility."


malfeasance
A somewhat official form of misconduct. If a public official commits a crime
while in office, he or she commits a malfeasance. The word is generally not used
to refer to ordinary people; they commit crimes. Embezzling campaign funds for

malice
The desire to see a great deal of evil done upon another. Worse than spite or
holding a grudge, malice is serious hatred. Pronounced mahl-iss.


malinger
To pretend to be sick in order to avoid work. A child who doesn't want to go
to school can pretend to have a sore throat. If he wants to be honest, he can
tell his parents he's malingering and hope they don't know what the word means.


manque
The word is usually combined with "artist" or "poet," as in artist manque,
perhaps because it means unfulfilled or might-have-been. (After all, who ever
heard of an accountant manque?.


mare's-nest
Something thought to be a great discovery that is really nothing more than a
big hoax is a mare's-nest. Maybe the name comes from the fact that horses can't
lay eggs?


martinet
A strict disciplinarian. It has a military connotation—but it doesn't have to.
General Patton was a martinet; but so was that evil history teacher who gave you
too much homework every night.


matutinal
A rather economical way of saying "happening in the morning" from the French
"matin." Breakfast is a matutinal meal; many people like to take matutinal
walks; certain radio programs are matutinal.

O.K. to confuse with meander, which means more or less the same thing. To
maunder is to walk or talk in a random or confused manner. "The sick man,
flushed with fever, maundered on about his wasted life."


maverick
In the spirit of the famed TV sheriff, a maverick is a nonconformist or a rebel,
a person whose thoughts and actions are different from most others. A maverick
is willing to break ground with his beliefs. An iconoclast (see iconoclast)
believes in attacking established beliefs, but a maverick believes in creating
new ones. The Beatles were mavericks in rock and roll; Einstein was a maverick
physicist.


mawkish
Overly sentimental or maudlin. Your great-aunt, who is always hugging and crying
and talking about who's in her will, is mawkish. It's not a good way to be. Soap
operas are mawkish; so are bad movies.


meet
There's a nice, slightly archaic, meaning for this word aside from the obvious
one. Something that is meet is fitting, suitable or appropriate. Wearing a tie
to certain restaurants is meet attire. Coming up with a good retort is finding
meet words for the situation and avoiding an esprit d'escalier (see esprit
d'escalier).

A depression or sinking into low spirits. Someone down in the dumps is suffering
the megrims.

with go.

and the Dragnet team to describe the telltale signs a criminal leaves behind,

zenith). It is often used, however, to connote a low point, as in the nadir of

reincarnation that leads to the end of all desire and suffering, but it has come

come across as someone with a great vocabulary. Someone who does love wine is an
oenophile.

mothers are officious, as are strangers who tell you what you should or
shouldn't do. Officials are rarely officious, and officious people are not

orthography

a nap: lazy, drowsy, inattentive and unfocused. It can be used to describe
a physical condition or a state of mind. More temporary than narcolepsy (see
narcolepsy).


osculate
To kiss and/or hug. Like pulchritude (see pulchritude), this is an ugly word for
a wonderful action. The word was probably created by a lexicographer who didn't
do enough osculating.

to become brittle and bone-hard (like a slice of bread after it's been lying

Idle chitchat or meaningless chatter. Adults make palaver at cocktail parties,
as do teenagers on the telephone.

and reused a second time. This is the kind of word that crops up in auctions for
famous manuscripts and at antique stores that deal in old books and prints. It

a previously completed and erased work shines through. An example—math homework
in which a teacher can see the ways that a student attempted to solve a problem
before coming up with the final answer.

Adam" or "RADAR" or "A man, a plan, a canal—Panama!"


palliative
Something that eases or soothes a situation, feeling or condition without
solving or curing it. Aspirin, for example, is a palliative because it can take
away the fever caused by a virus, but can't cure the virus itself. Giving a
crying child a lollipop after an allergy shot has a palliative effect.


panacea
A cure for all ills. Since nothing is a cure-all, the word is usually used
in the negative, as in: "The new government policy is not a panacea for all
of society's ills, but it will relieve certain economic burdens of the poor."


pandemic
Distributed or prevalent practically throughout the world; universal.
Homelessness is a problem pandemic to every urban society. Throughout the world,
Coca-Cola is the pandemic drink of choice. A pandemic is similar to an epidemic,

A speech that lavishly praises someone or something. A homeopathic (see
homeopathy) doctor might deliver a panegyric on the healing qualities of
ginseng.


panjandrum
A pompous, self-important official, such as the people who check your bags
at customs or the oh-so- helpful assistants behind the desks in motor vehicle
bureaus. If you're really frustrated by the way they treat you, you could
probably call them panjandrums and get away with it.


panoply
A complete array of something that is usually quite splendid in its breadth and
size. "A panoply of flowers blanketed the open field." "A panoply of desserts
covered the wedding buffet table."

fringed paper wrapped around the end of a lamb chop. You see fewer and fewer of
them, but they're still around in certain fine restaurants.


paraclete
A person you call upon to intercede. Referees, umpires, and judges are all

areas.

example: after being told about a pet that barks, likes bones, chases cats and
wags its tail, you say, "Oh, I didn't know you had a parrot."


paraph
The word for the elaborate flourishes people add to their signatures to make
them unique. Think John Hancock. In this age of Bic pens, they're rapidly
disappearing.


paravalent
Sexually potent only in unusual circumstances—a fancy word for kinky.


parlous
You might think this has something to do with speech or parlance, but it
doesn't. It means perilous, dangerous and difficult to escape from. "After a
number of parlous incidents in the jungle, which included being bitten by snakes
and shot at by poachers, the tourists decided to take their next vacation in
Miami."


parochial
Excessively narrow in outlook; having backward views stemming from a lack
of worldly experience. People who live in small towns are often considered
parochial in their attitudes and beliefs. Don't confuse with parochial schools,
which, while often parochial, may not be.


paroxysm
A fit or outburst, often of emotion, as in: "The comedian inspired the crowd to
paroxysms of laughter."


parure
A matched set of jewelry, such as earrings and a necklace; the kind of word seen
most often on museum cards and in auction catalogues. Save the word for when
you're talking about diamonds and emeralds—not Bakelite.


parvenu
A subtler word for what we usually call nouveau riche. A parvenu is someone
who has recently acquired money or social status, but has not yet acquired the
appropriate style or manner. The word can also be used to describe any newcomer
to a situation who has not yet learned to handle his role or responsibility,
such as a young worker who gets a big promotion and acts obnoxious and superior
around the people who were his closest colleagues the day before.

The attribution of human emotions to elements of nature; for example, describing
a rainy day as a sad or depressing day. Distinguish from anthropomorphism (see
anthropomorphism), which attributes human characteristics to inanimate objects.

from bathos (see bathos), which chronicles a fall from the sublime to the
commonplace.

that forms on bronze or copper after oxidation that is thought to add beauty.
You could be figurative and use it to describe a person's manner and appearance.

distinct from the standard language. Natives of Caribbean islands, for instance,
converse in French or English or Dutch with tourists, but speak patois among
themselves.

Two very different but useful meanings. To patronize a store means to do
business there, while to patronize a fellow human is to condescend to him or
her: "Of course, I'll be there on time. Let me give you a signed statement."


peccadillo
The word refers to small sins or minor offenses, often sexual. When a married
woman has a brief affair, she has a peccadillo. If a worker borrows a few
dollars from petty cash and takes a long time to pay it back, that's also
a peccadillo.


peccant
This does not mean spicy and flavorful; that's piquant (see piquant). Guilty
of a moral sin. Perhaps the woman who had a peccadillo (see above) could be
considered peccant.


pedagogue
This word can simply mean "teacher," but more often it has the same meaning as
pedant (see below), an extremely opinionated teacher who tries to force those
opinions on others, ignoring common sense in favor of theoretical knowledge.


pedant
A teacher, but the implication is one who is tiresome, and always focused on
small details. "Be careful with your new-found vocabulary skills, or you'll
become a pedant and no one will talk to you any more." (See pedagogue above.)


pellucid
Transparent or translucent; as long as you can see through something, you may
call it pellucid.


penicil
No, it's not a writing implement. In fact, it's the kind of short, bristly
tufts of hair or fur you find along the backs of caterpillars. A great word for
crossword puzzles or for teasing a friend who just got a punk haircut.


pentimento

wrote of his peregrinations in On the Road.


peremptory
Dictatorial or authoritarian; allowing no room for argument. Brusque. "Go to

perfervid
Extremely ardent or intense; fervent to the nth degree. Zealots are perfervid,
whatever their cause. (See also messianic.)


perfidious
Treacherous; nefarious; wicked. There are lots of words for evil; perfidious
carries a note of disloyalty or betrayal. Benedict Arnold was perfidious. To
call him a perfidious traitor would be redundant.


perfidy
The quality or state of being faithless or disloyal : treachery. An act or an
instance of disloyalty. In the context of war, perfidy is a form of deception in
which one side promises to act in good faith with the intention of breaking that
promise once the unsuspecting enemy is exposed.

perfunctorily reveals no particular passion and seems careless. A perfunctory
greeting lacks enthusiasm.

This word is used to describe language that conveys friendship or sociability
rather than information. Greetings exchanged among friends at a party, or
conversations on a receiving line at a wedding or funeral, are generally phatic.


phenology

indicator of mental characteristics. Phenology is the study of the role of
climate in annually recurring natural phenomena, such as bird migration, animal
hibernation, plant flowerings and so forth.


philipic
Sounds like a cure for indigestion, but it's more likely to cause a stomachache
than cure one. A philipic is a hostile speech that denounces a person or thing
with great bitterness. Demonstrators deliver philipics during rallies; furious
spouses deliver philipics against erring partners. Pronounced PHIL-IPP-ICK.

An uncultured person; someone who has no interest or knowledge of art or
civilization. Someone who'd rather go skateboarding than to a museum would be
considered funloving by some and a philistine by others.

who's been around the world several times is either a philobat or has a very
tough job in sales.

quixotic). Take care to distinguish from picturesque, which describes pleasant
scenery.

A fancy word for a fake column, the kind that doesn't stand freely, but runs
along the walls of rooms that are trying to resemble the Colosseum in Rome or an
ancient Greek ruin.


pindlin

trifling.


pintle
Like peanut butter is to jelly, a pintle is inextricably linked with a gudgeon,
a metal pivot. The pintle is a little pin that sticks into the hinge-like holes
of the gudgeon, holding a rudder to the back of a small sailboat. When you're
searching for a figurative phrase to describe an interlocked set, say, "They fit
like a pintle and gudgeon."


piquant
Not to be confused with peccant (see peccant). A pleasantly sharp or spicy
flavor. Good marinara sauce, Cajun ribs, Szechwan beef and chicken Vindaloo are
all piquant. Classier than saying "hot," and having to explain you mean spicy.


pismire
Another word for "ant." You can use it to refer to the little bug, or to
describe something equally tiny. It's a good word to use when you're annoyed
with someone, as in: "I'm tired of your pismire hobbies that leave no time for
more important things." Pronounced PISS-MIRE.

geological epoch that immediately precedes our present epoch. If you haven't
seen someone for a while, you can hyperbolize (see hyperbole) back to the
Pleistocene era.


plenipotentiary
A person vested with the full power to act on behalf of someone else. It's more
than a power of attorney. A parent may act as a plenipotentiary for a child; an

Government by the wealthy—not by the dog from the Walt Disney cartoons. Say
PLOO-TOCK-REH-SEE.


pococurante
How's this for a great insult? Someone who is careless or shows little concern

Mashed taro root. Rhymes with boy. A very mushy, traditional Hawaiian dish that

refined and polite way of saying so. With great politesse, the butler bowed and
led the guests into the drawing room. In general, people with drawing rooms act
with politesse.


polyandry
You know monogamy and bigamy, but this word belongs exclusively to women.
It's the act of having more than one husband at a time. Don't confuse it with
polygyny (that's having more than one wife at a time) or polygamy (either spouse
having more than one partner at a time).


polyglot
A polyglot is able to speak several languages fluently. A polyglot group is
composed of people who speak a variety of languages, such as the U.N.'s General
Assembly.

algebra courses. A polymath is someone who knows a great deal about a lot of

polymorphous
Occurring in any number of varied forms, such as the voice of a mockingbird
which can imitate other birds or the changing colors of a chameleon.

popinjay

describe words that combine or blend other words like "smog" or "docudrama."

ornament, usually added to a sculpture or work that is already finished. Think

A word that is always used after another. For example, manque (see manque) never
stands alone, instead we say "artist manque."

snifter of brandy. If it happens before dinner, it's called preprandial— imagine
a cocktail or, if it's a weekend, a nap.

commotion: "Don't make such a pother about it. We promised we'd visit our
relatives, and we're going."


precept
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/precept

know the word, but do you know that it's pronounced PRESS'lj?

pronounced PREE-TER-HYOO-MAN.


preternatural
Beyond the course of nature—almost supernatural. The forest can be
preternaturally quiet—so quiet that it's not natural.
prevaricate
Not quite fibbing, but close. When you prevaricate, you make vague or misleading
statements without telling an outright falsehood. If you don't want to go
somewhere and you're feeling healthy, "I can't make it tonight. I'm sick" is a
lie; "I'm not sure I can make it tonight. I'll get there if I can but don't wait
for me" is a prevarication.


prima facie
A Latin term for self-evident or apparent. Getting caught with your hand in the
cookie jar is prima facie evidence of theft.

books used in one-room school- houses, it can now be applied to software

is proactive precedes, even promotes or prevents, a situation. Politicians
are reactive; good chess players are proactive. probity Honesty; integrity;
incorruptibility. Has nothing to do with probability or wills.
probity
Integrity, especially of the quality of having strong moral principles; decency
and honesty. Synonyms: godliness, goodness, honour, righteousness, saintliness,

profligacy
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/profligacy


prognosticate
To predict from available facts, to foresee or prophesize. The word has to
do with making a judgment based on available information rather than using

the economy based on certain indicators; pollsters prognosticate the outcome of
elections based on polling results.


projection bias
Cognitive bias: overestimating the degree to which other people agree with us.

Daringly original; innovative and creative. In Greek mythology, Prometheus got
in big trouble for stealing fire from Mount Olympus and giving it to mankind.


propinquity

propinquity to it; two people who share spiritual, philosophical or intellectual
ideas also have a propinquity. The physical or psychological proximity between
people.


prosaic
It doesn't mean fancy—exactly the opposite. The word literally means commonplace
or ordinary but has an added touch of meaning boring and dull. Apricot tea is
exotic; orange pekoe is prosaic.


proscribe
The noun for this verb is proscription and it means almost the exact opposite
of "prescription." To proscribe something is to forbid it or label it dangerous.
Tea and toast would be prescribed for an upset stomach; red-hot chili peppers
would be proscribed.


proselytize
Someone who proselytizes tries to convert others by using strongly persuasive
language or convincing argument. It implies a certain degree of oppressive
lecturing. Demonstrators proselytize about their causes, as do zealots, fanatics
and members of some organized religions.


protean
Easily changeable from one form to another. Someone who can fit into any social
situation, changing types to fit the circumstances, is protean.


Proustian
This is a reference to Marcel Proust's novel Remembrance of Things Past, in
which the protagonist takes a bite of a pastry he enjoyed as a child, and the
taste of the pastry evokes a flood of childhood memories. The term has come
to mean any sensory experience that provokes a flood of nostalgia. When an
adult has a glass of chocolate milk and an Oreo, he or she is likely to have a
Proustian experience. The smell of newly-mown grass is often Proustian, evoking
memories of summer camp or trips to the country.


provenance
Place of origin or source. Frequently used when obtaining information about a
work of art or an antique. The next time you're in a posh antique store and want
to give the impression that you belong there, say to the owner, "Can you tell
something about the provenance of this crystal thingee?"


puce
No one is quite clear about what color puce really is. Some say chartreuse;
others guess pinkish-purple. Others shrug and offer, "Green?" Well, here's the
official answer: the word comes from the French word for "flea" and designates
the color of a flea, which, if you put that flea under a microscope, you would
discover is purplish-brown. Rhymes with loose.


puerile
There is great debate about the pronunciation of this word, which means
"childish or immature." Grownups who go around their offices sticking "Kick Me"
signs on the backs of their coworkers are considered puerile, especially by the
people who get the signs stuck on their backs.


pulchritude
The opposite of what it sounds like. Someone of great pulchritude is absolutely
beautiful. The only known use of this word is to confuse those who hear it. A
person of breathtaking, heartbreaking beauty is pulchritudinous.


punctilious
A punctilious person is someone who is meticulous and pays attention to details,
punctuation or otherwise. Marked by or concerned about precise accordance with the
details of codes or conventions


purlieu
There are several definitions for this word, but the most usable one is a
habitat or a place one frequents. The local bar is the purlieu for certain
folks; the library is the purlieu for others. When you are in your particular
purlieu, it becomes your milieu (see milieu). Short of breath,
especially because of being too fat. The obese man in front of you who is slowly
climbing the steps pursy and panting heavily is pursy. Vivid word, isn't it?


putsch
The German word for a sudden uprising and takeover. It generally refers to a
government coup, but if a group of coworkers get together to kick out their
superior and take over her responsibilities, that's a putsch too. Rhymes with
butch.


pyrrhic
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pyrrhic


quagmire
This word means swamp or bog or any earth that shakes when trodden upon, but it
is probably more often used figuratively to mean a murky mess. A teenager's room
might be a quagmire of dirty clothes, food wrappers and old magazines; a bad
answer to an essay question on an exam might be a quagmire of poorly expressed
thoughts and conflicting ideas.


quash
This is not a vegetable akin to eggplant or zucchini; it's a verb that means
"to put an end to" or "to get rid of." Mostly you quash ideas or feelings, not
people (that's murder).


quasi
A word you always see in combination with another word, as in "quasi-
intelligence," "quasi-healthy," "quasi-important." It means seeming to be,
but not really being. A quasi-intelligent person probably sounds smart and
insightful, but if you listen carefully he may be saying very little. Quasi-
healthy food may be labeled "all natural" but contain lots of sugar or fat.
Pronounced QWAY-ZEE or KWAH-ZEE.


quay
An often misused word. A quay is a wharf, not a bay. So a walk out on Hawk's
Quay in Florida won't get you wet.


querulous
Complaining in a whining, peevish sort of way. Parents become irritated or
annoyed when their children misbehave; children become querulous when they're
forced to behave. A querulous adult is probably acting like a child.


quid pro quo
Tit for tat; something given in return. If you are a vengeful person and I'm
nasty to you, quid pro quo you'll be nasty to me. Pronounced KW1D PRO KWO.


quidnunc
A gossip. The only word that ends in unc.


quiescent
A nice word for "motionless" or "still." If someone isn't talking, he's quiet;
if he's lying down, he's sleeping or relaxing; if he's sitting motionless on
a couch and staring into space, he's quiescent (or catatonic). A still lake at
dawn is quiescent. The coolest use of this word is for the Popsicle, which is
quiescently frozen.


quincunx
A hard word to say (and even harder to spell). It means the arrangement of
five objects with one at each corner of a square, and the remaining one in
the center. Think of the arrangement of a five of hearts on a playing card (or
anything else arranged like the five on a playing card). Pronounced KWING-KUNKS.


quisling
A collaborating spy. The word derives from Major Vidkun Quisling, who aided
the German invaders of his native Norway during World War II. It can be used to
refer to anyone who spies on his own group for the benefit of a competitor.


quixotic
This word is often misused to mean "flaky" or "changeable." In fact, as anyone
who remembers the story of Don Quixote knows, a quixotic person is someone who
is romantic and idealistic and pursues lofty but impractical goals. One grows
impatient with people but rarely dislikes them.


quotidian
Ordinary, common, or occurring every day, such as a dose of vitamins.


raconteur
A great storyteller; the kind of person who tells wonderfully amusing anecdotes
with split-second timing and a great choice of words. Mark Twain is perhaps the
most famous example.


raffish
Tacky, cheap or in bad taste. The word can refer to people or things. A tourist
dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and plaid shorts looks raffish, as do most of the
doo-dads sold in airport souvenir shops.


raillery
Not the stuff trains run on. Pronounced RAY-LER-EE, it's another word for good-
natured banter and light teasing. (See also bavardage.) This belongs with
papilote (see papilote) in the "Obscure Restaurant" list.

This word was first a military term but has expanded to mean checking anything
out in advance of doing it. You can reconnoiter a parking lot for available
spaces, for instance, before driving your car in.


recreant
This has nothing to do with play or outdoor sports; a recreant is a traitor or
a coward, someone who abandons his friends, family or country.


recrudesce
To recur, or break out anew after a dormant period.


rectitude
Moral righteousness or integrity. People who say or do things with rectitude
have generally been truly good. There's no self-righteousness or hypocrisy
involved. Mother Theresa has rectitude, as do a lot of good people who are less
famous.


red herring

possibly controversial issue. Appears in Agatha Christie mysteries all the time.
In a different context, it's also used to denote a printed prospectus detailing

redolent
A very musical word for fragrant or sweet-smelling. Gardens are redolent in

flavor." Dull lectures, B-movies, and tranquilizers are soporifics; red pepper,
hot fudge, and curry are all saporifics. Not to be confused with soporific
(seeit SAHN SUE-SEE soporific),.


sardonic
Bitter or scornful. It can describe a sense of humor, a personality type or a
work of art.


sartorial
Relating to clothing, especially men's clothing. The emperor who wanted new
clothes called on the sartorial skills of everyone in his kingdom.


saturnalia
A period of wild revelry. Bacchanals (see bacchanal) are drunken revelries in
imitation of the Roman god Bacchus. Similarly, saturnalia honors Saturn, the
Roman god of agriculture. Interestingly enough, though saturnalias are wild
parties, a saturnine person is cold, gloomy and depressed.


scarify
To make superficial cuts or scratches. Certain African and Latin American
tribes scarify their faces and bodies for decoration. The word can also be used
in a figurative sense to mean making small insults, wounding with words. "The
children scarified the new kid in the class by teasing him mercilessly about the
way he dressed." Pronounced SCAR-IF-EVE.


scatology
The study of or excessive interest in excrement or obscenity, such as the works
of William S. Burroughs or Laurence Sterne.

reason. If a teacher takes a scunner to you, you're in trouble.


scurrilous
Incredibly abusive, obscenely nasty. Villains are guilty of scurrilous deeds.
This is a good word to use when you need to yell at someone who's made you
furious, as in: "I'm sick and tired of your scurrilous treatment of me and
everyone else around you."


sedulous
Someone who is sedulous is diligent and persevering and never gives up the ship,
such as the Terminator, or, on the brighter side, the pioneers who settled the
West.


self-consistency bias
Cognitive bias: The psychological tendency to see oneself as consistent which
affects our actions.


self-serving bias
Cognitive bias: people's tendency to attribute positive events to their own
character but attribute negative events to external factors.


semantics
The aspect of linguistics that is concerned with the meaning and usage of words.
Being precise in what you say and how you say it is the greatest benefit of
semantics. When someone's response to your argument is that you're just playing
with semantics, they've decided to stop fighting about the facts, and to start
accusing you of using double talk (which you would never do, of course).


seminal
Despite the i, the word derives from "semen," and means the source of a style,
an idea or a philosophy. The Federalist Papers are a seminal work of American
political thought; Einstein's work is seminal to modern physics.

fascinating field of study.

sense impressions.


sequacious
Following smoothly or logically; happening in a sequence. A sequacious argument
would be hard to argue with; a sequacious movie would be easy to follow.

traveler's checks.


serial position effect
Cognitive bias: Serial-position effect is the tendency of a person to recall the
first and last items in a series best, and the middle items worst.

attached or established : not free to move about


sexagenarian

certain heavy-metal rock stars are considered to be shamans by their young fans.

1941–45; the Ηolocaust.


sibilant
Any speech sound that resembles a hiss; in particular, words that begin with
s, z or sh. Of course, it's all in the way you pronounce them. "Yes" is not
necessarily sibilant, but could be: '"Yessssssssss, my pretty,' said the wicked
witch." If you like, you can pronounce it SSSSSSSSIB-EH-LANT.


SIC
Intentionally written. When used in printed materials, it means, "The person who
wrote this article/ letter/speech is an idiot; look at the mistake he made. But
we the editors are smart, so don't blame us." Place it in parentheses after a
misteak (sic).


sidereal
Relating to or determined by the stars. Astrologers profit from selling phony

but which requires almost no work. Certain ambassadors' posts are considered
sinecures, for example, because the job involves a lot of formal parties and
official gatherings but very little political responsibility.


sinistrodextral
Moving from left to right. An obvious example: written English is a

a pleasing taste, flavor or character, such as a good full-bodied wine or a
strong cheese.

alluring and almost dangerously tempting. Michelle Pfeiffer frequently plays
sirenic roles. Pronounced SY-REN-LCK.

spoon and a half gallon of ice cream, just grin and say you're having an attack
of sitomania.

an object or feature which imitates the design of a similar artifact made from
another material. In computing, an element of a graphical user interface which
mimics a physical object.


skulduggery
If you do something sneaky and underhanded, you are engaging in skulduggery.
Though it's clearly dishonorable conduct, it's not as bad as an outright felony
—you don't necessarily get thrown in jail for it. Filling your mom's purse with
raspberry Jell-O is skulduggery. Also spelled skullduggery.


sloven
This is the noun for "slovenly." People who dress in a slovenly way are
carelessly sloppy; sloven, therefore, is another word for slob. You can also use
it as a name for someone who does a job poorly or haphazardly. The guy who came
in to wash your windows and left great big streaks on the glass is a sloven.


slubber
To do hastily and carelessly. A sloven (see above) slubbers his work.

staring contemptuously and you've got it—a sniffish snob.


snood
The Yuppie hairband made famous by Hillary Clinton is called a snood. Also a
netlike cap worn by women. A snood was originally a badge of virginity. Now it
just keeps your hair out of your eyes. Rhymes with food. Moniker, another word
for nickname. Chicago's sobriquet sobriquet is "The Windy City."
sociopath
A favorite insult to hurl at selfish, nasty, ungenerous and unthoughtful people,
the word is a clinical term meaning someone who is hostile to society. Serial
killers are often sociopaths.


sodality

particular purpose, such as listening to live music, holding a discussion group

"who" when he should say "whom," or "me" when he should say "I," speaks in
solecisms.


solipsism
This philosophical theory asserts that the self is the only thing that exists
or can be proved to exist, but its meaning has now been stretched to convey
narcissism. Any person who sees him- or herself as the center of the universe
may be called solipsistic.

origin. Almost the opposite of someone who believes that all illnesses are
psychosomatic, or psychological in origin.

Hermione."


sough
To make a sighing or rustling sound. Trees sough in a gentle wind. On a breezy
day, the reeds along the edge of a pond sough.


soupçon
The French word for a hint, a dash, a trace. It can be used in a recipe, such
as a soupçon of brandy in the chowder, but it's commonly used figuratively as
well. "The comedy was a delightful mix of terrific acting, slapstick humor and a
soupçon of social parody.


spado
Another word for a castrated man or animal (see also eunuch). Literally.
Rhymes with Play-Dough.


sparge
A sparge is a sprinkling or a spattering, like a sparge of wild lilies along
the side of a highway. It can also be used as a verb, but it sounds more awkward
than "scatter" or "sprinkle."


specious
Something that seems correct on the surface but turns out to be false or wrong.
A specious argument sounds great but doesn't prove its point.


spelunk
To explore caves. We wonder if spelunkers get their equipment in the same store
as keglers do (see kegler). Note that if you need to know the difference between
a stalactite (see stalactite) and a stalagmite, you should ask a spelunker.


spiniferous

Blowfish and porcupines are spiniferous. The word means "covered with spines."


spoonerism

spoor
One of those words you hear often but are never quite sure what it means — a track
or trail of bones, dung, or fur made by a person or an animal being hunted.

fake, it's spurious.


squib
A short, witty composition or saying, often an item in a newspaper. It also
describes a short football kick.


stalactite
Not, of course, to be confused with stalagmite. Let's sort them out once and for
all: a stalactite is the icicle-like formation that hangs from the roof or wall
of a cave. A stalagmite is a deposit on the floor of the cave that looks like
an inverted stalactite. Remember that stalactites must be tight to stay on the
roof of the cave and you'll be all set. Both are made from crystalline calcium
carbonate buildup.


stalwart
Stout; steady; dependably courageous. Friends who can be counted on for their
bravery and loyalty are stalwart.


stentorian

observations each of which is considered as a sample of one element from a

Adjacent means side by side; so subjacent means lying directly under. "The
basement of the house was subjacent to the living room."


subrogate
To substitute, as in subrogating fat-free foods for ice cream and butter when
you're on a diet. When your history teacher was sick and you got a replacement
for the day, she was not called a subrogate teacher because that's just not the
idiom! Don't confuse subrogate with surrogate, which means more or less the same
thing, but can be used as a noun.


subsume
To consider an idea, principle, theory or category as part of a larger whole.
"Existentialism is subsumed by philosophy in the liberal arts class offerings at
the university."

voluptuous, like Rita Hayworth or Kathleen Turner.

This word often crops up in highly descriptive prose. It means a gentle

Leister or Lester, and Worcester pronounced Wooster). In pathology: a loss of
consciousness when someone faints, a swoon. In music: a missed beat or off-beat
stress in music resulting in syncopation.


synecdoche
A figure of speech in which a part is substituted for the whole, such as "Get
your butt in here." (Obviously the speaker wants more than just your posterior.)
Or the whole may be used to describe a part, as in "Big Business is responsible
for polluting this lake."


synergy
Cooperative activity. Getting more than the sum of the parts. Synergy occurs in
an office, for example, when coworkers give each other energy and inspire each
other to be more creative and productive than they would be alone.

Earth, and Moon) such that one body is directly between the other two, such as

taciturn
Preferring to remain silent; unwilling to talk. Children are often taciturn
when they are asked to explain their behavior; adults are taciturn whenever
they prefer to keep their feelings private. Taciturn people generally don't
join group therapy unless they're trying to get over their unwillingness to talk
to people.


talaria
The winged sandals worn by Mercury. Granted, Mercury and FTD are probably the
only people who need to use this word regularly, but think about all those times

tautology
Redundant use of words, a pleonasm, an unnecessary and tedious repetition.


taxonomy
A taxonomy (or taxonomical classification) is a scheme of classification,
especially a hierarchical classification, in which things are organized into
groups or types. Among other things, a taxonomy can be used to organize and
index knowledge (stored as documents, articles, videos, etc.), such as in
the form of a library classification system, or a search engine taxonomy, so
that users can more easily find the information they are searching for. Many
taxonomies are hierarchies (and thus, have an intrinsic tree structure), but not
all are.


telegenic
Sounds like a fortuneteller or someone with supernatural powers, but it's
not. Someone who is telegenic looks good on television or, to use the more
contemporary phrase, is videogenic.


teleology
The belief that all things in nature are created for a particular purpose.
Evolution is all about teleology— the duckbilled platypus has developed a
duckbill because it is useful in an overall natural design. Misused, this
reasoning can give rise to statements like, "If man were meant to fly, he'd have
wings." Pronounced TEL-EE-AHL-OH-JEE.


temblor
Another word for earthquake. Most often used by reporters in California in
reporting on yet another earthquake. Note that the word is not tremblor, which
may seem more accurate, but doesn't exist!


temerity

mugging victim has courage; a student who talks back to a teacher has temerity.


tendentious

having a particular tendency; leaning; lacking impartiality. Tendentious people
make poor judges.

thalassic
Of or relating to seas and oceans or smaller bodies of water, as seas and gulfs.


theomania
Here's a great one to throw at that narcissistic friend of yours the next time
you get in an argument. A theomaniac is someone who believes he is God or has

messianic), which can have less heavenly associations.


thersitical
Verbally abusive; using foul language. When you hurl curses at someone, you are
being thersitical.


thespian
Anything relating to acting or the theatre. A small town's thespian society is
responsible for the local theatre.


throe

emotion. Adolescents frequently find themselves in the throes of despair; new
lovers are usually in the throes of passion.

timorous
Meek, fearful; another word for timid. Yes, you can be timorous as a mouse.

Edgar Allan Poe's poem, "The Bells."

This has nothing to do with those things in your throat that swell up when

A name which is derived from the name of a place, such as Indiana Jones or
Broadway Joe Namath.

a winding, twisting or crooked road; a tortuous argument is so convoluted that
it's hard to follow.


traduce

brutal, savage. The behavior of the Nazis during the Holocaust was truculent.

Oily or slimy. Not a literal description as much as a way of describing
someone's character. A person who is overly flattering or too smooth is
unctuous. Lounge lizards, for example, are unctuous.


unexceptionable
A nice word that should not be confused with unexceptional. Unexceptional means
ordinary or average. Unexceptionable means without exception or fault; beyond
criticism.


unseemly
Inappropriate; not in keeping with good taste. Walking into a fancy French
restaurant without shoes on is unseemly behavior.


untoward

question of good taste as of being rude. Pronounced UN-TORD.

illegal, exorbitant rates (like those used for credit cards) can be described as

submissive to his spouse is uxorious.


vacuous
Empty-headed; without ideas or purpose. It's often used to describe someone

paradigm) for vacuity.


vagary
A whimsical, capricious or eccentric idea or action. Pronounced VAY-GER-EE.


valetudinarian
This is not the smart student who makes a speech at graduation (that's a
valedictorian). A valetudinarian is an invalid or a convalescing person who is
obsessed with his poor health. Distinguish from a hypochondriac, who has the
same feelings, but is healthy.


vassal
A subordinate. Not exactly a slave—more like a subject. From the feudal
relationship between kings and their subjects. You could use the term
sarcastically to refer to the boss's assistants.


vatic
Describing or predicting what will happen in the future.


vaunt

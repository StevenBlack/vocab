nirvana
This word refers to the Buddhist belief in the release from
the cycle of reincarnation that leads to the end of all desire
and suffering, but it has come to be used to mean a state
akin to heaven on earth. A birthday party with a big cake,
lots of candy and ice cream, and piles of presents may be
a child's idea of nirvana.

nodus
A complication or a difficulty, kind of like a snag. If you
hit a nodus in your research, you're likely to be stuck for
days trying to discover the right answer. The plural is
nodi. Pronounced NODE-US.

noisome
If you think this has to do with an assault on the ears,
you've got the wrong organ. Strangely enough, the word
means foul-smelling. The diaper bin is noisome.
Pronounced NOY-SUM.

nom de guerre
From the French, it means the same thing as "pseu-
donym." Robert Zimmerman's nom de guerre, for
example, is Bob Dylan. If you're going to use it,
pronounce it correctly: NOME DE GAIR.

nubbin
This word means exactly what it sounds likeâ€”a
lumpy stub, a bumpy nub. The pills that form on
sweaters after you've worn them for a time could just
as well be called nubbins.

nubile
Of marriageable age or condition. Since that once
meant about 15 years of age, the word came to mean
all attractive, young women. Pronounce it NOO-BILE
or NOO-BILL.
